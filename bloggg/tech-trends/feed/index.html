										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In the past few years, it has become less important for organizations to have all their employees under the same roof. They turn to <a href="https://intellectsoft.net/services/outsourcing-software-development-services" rel="noopener noreferrer">outsourcing</a>, <a href="https://intellectsoft.net/services/dedicated-development-team" rel="noopener noreferrer">hiring teams</a> with the right skills for major IT projects from third parties. When it comes to software development, outsourcing options include <a href="https://intellectsoft.net/bloggg/offshore-software-development" rel="noopener noreferrer">offshore</a>, onshore, and nearshore. All of these options differ, and choosing the one that fits your project best can be a complicated task.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of nearshore outsourcing, or nearshoring, so you can see whether this model is the best choice for your business. The nearshore software development model offers benefits such as improved communication and collaboration due to minimal time zone differences and cultural similarities. Notable companies like Skype and Lamina Technologies have successfully utilized this model to support their product development and achieve high-quality results.</p>
<p>Nearshoring is a trend that has become highly popular among IT companies in the last decade. For many companies, this model has become a go-to solution, because some challenges of offshoring have resulted in critical failures.</p>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">U.S. companies have been using nearshore outsourcing since the 1990s, and it was one of the factors that enabled many of them to stay ahead of the competition. The model frees a company from hiring, training, and maintaining an in-house software development team, saving them time and money by providing the services of experienced software engineers with the right skills.</p>
<p>Now, let’s explore what nearshore software development is in greater detail and how it can help you make strides with your project.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Nearshore Software Development?</strong></h2>
<p>Nearshoring is a model of outsourcing that enables companies to delegate a software development project or business process to outsourcing companies or freelancing teams in nearby countries. This allows businesses to cut costs, save time, get instant access to the right technical expertise, as well as stay focused on other projects. Nearshore software developers play a crucial role in providing cost savings and real-time collaboration due to similar time zones, which often overlap with the client team.</p>
<p>A great example of nearshoring is outsourcing software development from Colombia to the USA or Canada. With the close proximity, shared culture, and similar time zones, it makes collaboration much easier.</p>
<p><em>At Slagato technology, we’re excited to be part of this growing trend. Earlier this year, we opened a new office in Bogotá, Colombia. This helps us deliver top-quality development solutions while keeping communication smooth and building strong relationships with our North American clients.</em></p>
<p>Communication in outsourcing is incredibly important, as any software development project involves a lot of interaction between all the teams. As a result, nearshore software development helps ensure smooth collaboration across the board.</p>

<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Definition of Nearshore Software Development</h3>
<p>Nearshore software development is a strategic outsourcing model where companies hire software developers from nearby locations, typically within a small time zone difference. This approach allows businesses to tap into cost-effective and high-quality software development services while benefiting from geographical and cultural proximity to the client. By leveraging nearshore software development, companies can ensure smoother communication, faster project turnaround times, and a more collaborative working relationship. This model is particularly advantageous for businesses looking to maintain close oversight and foster a strong partnership with their development team.</p>
<h3>How Nearshore Software Development Works</h3>
<p>Nearshore software development involves forming a partnership with a software development company or team located in a nearby country or region. The process begins with identifying a nearshore development partner that aligns with your project requirements and business goals. Once the partnership is established, the client and the nearshore development team collaborate closely to develop software solutions. The nearshore team brings in their expertise and resources to deliver high-quality results, while the client provides ongoing feedback and direction.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of nearshore software development is the ability to maintain smooth communication due to the minimal time zone differences. This allows for real-time collaboration, quick decision-making, and efficient problem-solving. Additionally, the nearshore model offers flexible hiring options and the ability to quickly scale the development team as needed, making it an attractive option for companies looking to outsource their software development needs.</p>
<h2>Types of IT Outsourcing Models</h2>
<p>There are three main types of IT outsourcing models: onshore, nearshore, and offshore. Each model has its unique advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of model depends on the client’s specific needs and requirements.</p>
<h3>Onshore vs Nearshoring Development</h3>
<p>Onshore software development involves hiring developers from the same country or region as the client. This model provides the benefits of geographical and cultural proximity, which can lead to seamless communication and collaboration. However, onshore development can be more expensive compared to nearshore or offshore options.</p>
<p>Nearshore software development, on the other hand, offers a balance between cost-effectiveness and proximity. By partnering with a nearshore software development company, businesses can enjoy the benefits of working with a team that is geographically close, shares similar cultural values, and operates within a similar time zone. This makes nearshore development a popular choice for companies looking to outsource their software development needs while maintaining a high level of collaboration and oversight.</p>
<h3>Offshore vs Nearshore Development</h3>
<p>Offshore software development involves hiring developers from a distant country, often with a significant time zone difference. While this model can be cost-effective, it may pose challenges in terms of communication and cultural differences. These challenges can lead to delays, misunderstandings, and a lack of alignment between the client and the development team.</p>
<p>Nearshore software development offers a more balanced approach, with a smaller time zone difference and greater cultural proximity. This makes it easier to communicate and collaborate with the development team, leading to more efficient project execution and higher-quality results. By choosing a nearshore software development company, businesses can benefit from cost-effective and high-quality software development services while enjoying the advantages of geographical and cultural proximity. With the right nearshore development partner, companies can achieve their software development goals and stay competitive in the market.</p>
<h2>Nearshore Outsourcing: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>
<p>Although nearshore outsourcing has become a top choice for companies across the world, it has its benefits and drawbacks like any other model. Nearshore software outsourcing, in particular, offers potential cost savings and better communication due to time zone proximity.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Nearshore Outsourcing</h3>
<p>Nearshoring has some big benefits that can help you finish your project successfully.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographical proximity.</strong> It is easier, quicker, and more cost-effective to have face-to-face meetings with the nearshoring team, as they are located in the nearby country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearshore software development services offer effective communication, control over projects, and are endorsed by major companies, making them an attractive option for various business needs.</p>
<p>Face-to-face meetings are always more productive than video calls, and the nearshore outsourcing model enables them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cultural similarities</strong>. Countries in the same region often have a lot in common when it comes to values, organizational structure, work ethics, thinking, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, they can collaborate, communicate, and solve issues more easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time zone alignment</strong>. One of the major advantages of nearshore outsourcing is that partnering companies can work in similar time zones, or with little difference in the hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, teams can have convenient collaboration during their working hours. This results in fewer costs and employee fatigue, positively impacting the development process for both sides. Time zone alignment is a key factor, making the nearshore outsource option stand out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22797" title="Nearshore Software Development Centers" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Centers.jpg" alt="Nearshore Software Development Centers" width="1280" height="848" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Centers.jpg 1280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Centers-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Centers-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Centers-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Centers-600x398.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Centers-450x298.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Centers-1000x663.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<ul data-pm-slice="3 1 []">
<li><strong>Frictionless communication.</strong> Proximity is a key benefit of nearshore software development, enabling frictionless communication. When your team members come from neighboring countries, they often share a lot and can have face-to-face meetings often.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, by opting for nearshoring you can ensure no detail is lost in the translation. This leads to less errors, stress, and faster time-to-market (T2M).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local talent availability</strong>. Your country and region may have the tech talent you need for your project, but finding, hiring, and managing them is a lot of work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearshoring is a shortcut to hiring experts with the right technical expertise and hard and soft skills in close proximity to your area of operation. The model is a blessing for companies who do not have the time to gather a team and need to start the project as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages of nearshore outsourcing</h3>
<p>Here are some of the model’s drawbacks that you need to consider before making a decision:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher price than offshoring.</strong> The services of outsourcing companies located in countries or regions near your area of operation will cost you more than hiring with the offshoring model.</li>
<li><strong>Fewer providers</strong>. This disadvantage largely depends on your location, but there are usually fewer nearshore companies than offshore ones.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring required</strong>. With nearshoring, you do not delegate the entire project to a third party and wait for the result — you need to monitor the work of the nearshoring team from time to time. This often entails hiring a project manager.</li>
<li><strong>Low proficiency</strong>. Not every country has neighboring countries with vast talent pools of developers, or simply the right experts. Sometimes, there are simply no ways to gather the right team with nearshoring and go with offshore outsourcing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Offshore development, on the other hand, presents its own set of challenges, such as significant time zone differences that can affect communication between clients and teams located abroad. These differences can lead to difficulties in scheduling meetings and maintaining project velocity, although offshore options can be more cost-effective.</p>
<h2>Nearshore Outsourcing Model is a Solid Option</h2>
<p>When you plan to outsource your software development project using the nearshore model, your business can achieve great results — fill in the tech talent gap, build a solution from scratch, or simply finish the project the previous team failed to deliver.</p>
<p>A nearshore software development partner can provide localized services at a competitive price, ensuring high-quality service, team extension, and tailored solutions while benefiting from working within the same time zone and cultural proximity.</p>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In short, nearshore software development is all about acquiring the right talent for your project, cost-efficiency, and frictionless collaboration. If you are looking for Agile and iterative software development strategies, quick communication, collaborative development practices, rapid prototyping, or user-focused design, nearshore outsourcing is your best bet.</p>
<h2>Tips on Finding Nearshore Software Development Companies</h2>
<p>With the rapid progress of technology, the world is changing very quickly. This forces many businesses to delegate their projects to nearshore outsourcing partners.</p>
<p>Finding the right nearshore development partner is extremely important, as many software development projects are long-term. Hiring nearshore developers offers access to a larger pool of qualified talent and ensures cultural alignment, which is crucial for smooth communication and project success. Plus, any software needs to be continuously maintained and updated with new features from time to time.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22805" title="Nearshore Software Development Teams" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Teams.jpg" alt="Nearshore Software Development Teams" width="1280" height="854" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Teams.jpg 1280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Teams-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Teams-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Teams-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Teams-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Teams-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Teams-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Build a Strategy to Find a Nearshore Software Development Team</h2>
<p>The nearshore custom software development team is an optimal choice for the companies that search for fully equipped and experienced developers who can tackle all sorts of tasks of the project. Especially, it is useful for businesses that do not need to have their own development team. It might seem easy at first, but every partnership requires a detailed plan.</p>
<p>The nearshore software development model offers significant benefits, such as improved communication and collaboration due to minimal time zone differences and cultural similarities.</p>
<p>There is no need to rush when choosing the right partner as you need a reliable, skilled team that can complete your project within stated timeframes. Although you have to take into consideration numerous details before making a deal with another company, still it is less than recruiting and training employees on your own.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes years to build a dream team and all the required resources for the corporation to be able to reach its goals independently.</p>
<p>So, how to build a strategy for nearshore partnership? Here are five steps to consider:</p>
<p><strong>1. Have specific requirements that clearly describe your objectives.</strong></p>
<p>Bring together all your departments, so everyone in your team is on the same page and knows the exact tasks that should be accomplished. Your managers and you should highlight the core requirements, make them clear, specific, and easy to understand, so there will not be any confusion when communicating with the partners.</p>
<p><strong>2. Make a list of possible candidates for cooperation and study their work in detail.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the company leads a transparent business and there are no hidden costs for the services. Check their portfolio, services they provide, go through the reviews, contact previous customers if necessary in order to get more details.</p>
<p><strong>3. Check whether the firm has all the necessary resources to complete the project, including staff and tech tools.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22796" title="Nearshore Software Development Benefits" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Benefits.jpg" alt="Nearshore Software Development Benefits" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Benefits.jpg 1280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Benefits-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Benefits-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Benefits-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Benefits-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Benefits-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Nearshore-Software-Development-Benefits-1000x666.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>4. See if you have one language in common.</strong></p>
<p>Language proficiency directly influences project success, so it is important for building strong and efficient relationships.</p>
<p><strong>5. Have meetings, so you can have a full picture of people you are going to work with/It’s easier to build bridges in this way.</strong></p>
<p>Nearshore outsourcing examples have shown that both teams are gaining a new and valuable experience that can be used in the future. They interact and exchange knowledge, enhance communicative skills, learn how to work with foreign companies, etc.</p>
<p>For instance, the USA corporations often choose to partner with Canada and Colombia, as well as other LATAM countries. The EU corporations often work together or look for the partner in Eastern Europe (Ukraine). All these countries have shown to have a huge potential in the IT field and there is a great number of talented teams. The nearshore partnership will help your company to expand its possibilities as you get access both to the professional workforce and the latest tech tools. Another important thing to check is company culture and the size of the team. Every outsourcing business wants to sell itself, so they will show only the good side.</p>
<p>Find the data about the company on the Internet, read reviews, try to find out whether they have labor flow, or create a comfortable environment for the employees. It is important to know if in case someone decides to leave the organization it will slow down the project and they might miss a deadline.</p>
<p>In addition, even if your partner is reliable and self-sufficient, you should always stay in touch with them, check whether you have the reports on the progress, make sure that all your board is also in the loop. Using a clear plan and well-thought strategy when looking for a nearshore outsourcing company will save you a lot of time and funds.</p>
<p>Plan carefully and assess the risks. This will account for half of your success, while the other half comes from partnering with a reliable and skilled team.</p>
<h2>Nearshore Development Is On the Rise</h2>
<p>Not only the technology companies can save money by using nearshore software development outsourcing — there are many other reasons to consider this model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Cost-effective, easy to deploy, and straightforwardly effective, beacons have become one of the most popular ways to engage with customers.</p>
<p>While decades ago the use of this technology was primarily seen in marketing and retail, in 2024, industries like healthcare, transportation, logistics, and many others are actively adopting beacons. This smart solution not only streamline business operations and helps gain more clients by providing real-time insights but also make a meaningful difference in patient care. For example, in healthcare, providers can use beacons to remind patients to take their medications and track the locations of patients in emergency rooms and large medical facilities.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at what the global market has to say about the rise of beacon technology.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27933" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/beacons-technology.png" alt="beacons technology" width="1550" height="1138" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/beacons-technology.png 1550w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/beacons-technology-300x220.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/beacons-technology-1024x752.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/beacons-technology-768x564.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/beacons-technology-1536x1128.png 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/beacons-technology-600x441.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/beacons-technology-450x330.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/beacons-technology-1000x734.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1550px) 100vw, 1550px" /></p>

In 2016, the beacon technology market was valued at 519.6 million U.S. dollars, and it&#8217;s projected to grow at a staggering CAGR of 59.8%, reaching approximately 56.6 billion U.S. dollars by 2026. That’s an incredibly promising outlook.</p>
<p>If you’re seeking a technology that can help you reach more clients, improve customer experiences, and deliver greater value — all in a cost-effective way — beacon technology is the way to go. To simplify your journey, we&#8217;ve compiled a guide that covers everything you need to know about beacons.</p>
<p>In this article, you’ll discover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is beacon technology</li>
<li>How does it work</li>
<li>The many types of beacons</li>
<li>How they benefit companies across industries</li>
<li>Pros and cons of the devices</li>
<li>How technology would evolve</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<h2><strong>What is Beacon Technology?</strong></h2>
<p>Beacon devices are at the heart of beacon technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>Most beacons are small computers, roughly the size of a standard Wi-Fi router.</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of indoor and outdoor positioning systems and Internet of Things (IoT) networks, beacons use proximity technology to detect human presence nearby and trigger preset actions to deliver informational, contextual, and personalized experiences.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Did Beacon Technology Begin?</strong></h2>
<p>The concept of beacons is as old as, for example, hand watches. Like lighthouses guide ships and show where the land is, beacon devices provide information and navigation to smartphone users. Beacon technology offers a new context for an old concept.</p>
<blockquote><p>As we know it now, the beacon technology was introduced by <a href="https://forbes.com/sites/homaycotte/2015/09/01/beacon-technology-the-what-who-how-why-and-where#30576ce91aaf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a> alongside a dedicated communication standard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Called iBeacon, it was soon followed by Google&#8217;s Eddystone. The location beacon, which is rough twice the size of Apple&#8217;s Wi-Fi router Airport was a typical beacon device in the first years since 2013.</p>
<p>In a short time, beacon technology spawned many startups and new beacon types. Unlike other new technologies like Augmented and Virtual Reality, beacons were straightforwardly effective and had a low price tag. On top of that, they provided new, exciting ways to engage customers in a non-intrusive way. As a result, many established retail companies quickly adopted beacons and started reaping their benefits.</p>
<h2><strong>How Do Beacons Work?</strong></h2>
<p>When a user walks past an area where a positioning system or IoT network with beacons is set up, the nearest beacon sends a code with a message to their mobile device. Then, the beacon recognizes the message pops up as a notification on a user&#8217;s mobile device with a third-party or branded mobile app.</p>
<p><strong>You need 3 things to make a beacon-based system work:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At least one more beacon device</li>
<li>Mobile app</li>
<li>User&#8217;s permission</li>
</ul>
<p>Beacon technology offerings usually consist of a software development kit (SDK), back end management tools, and beacon devices. So, you will need software engineers to set up your positioning system, more so if beacons are part of a vast IoT network that includes other smart devices too.</p>
<p>As for the user permission, your users make the final decision on whether they will receive beacon-based notifications and use your positioning system. Beacon technology works only with a smartphone and mobile app, so users can simply opt for turning off Bluetooth. There are also people who use their smartphones without keeping Bluetooth on all the time.</p>
<p>To overcome this obstacle, you can ask your users to turn on Bluetooth for the full customer experience, or even excite your users by notifying them about the beacon-based positioning system, presenting it as an innovative solution, and explaining what benefits it holds for them.</p>
<p>As a result, beacon technology appears as less intrusive than the similar RFID (radio-frequency identification) and other engagement tools, enabling a user experience where a user has a choice to opt out.</p>
<h3><strong>BLE as Bluetooth Beacon Technology</strong></h3>
<p>BLE beacon technology relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to transmit data and send out messages at regular intervals. BLE is a power-efficient Bluetooth technology developed for the Internet of Things applications and devices like beacons. With BLE, a beacon needs only one coin cell battery every three years, and the technology is 60 to 80 percent cheaper than the classic Bluetooth.</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Beacons</strong></h2>
<p>There is a wide array of beacons available for positioning systems of any type and scale. They differ in size, battery life, use cases, and level of resistance to exogenous factors. Here are the common types of beacons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard beacon </strong>(devices the size of a Wi-Fi router or smaller) for proximity solutions and indoor tracking.</li>
<li><strong>Portable/small beacon</strong> (the size of a credit card or big sticker) for asset tracking and proximity solutions.</li>
<li><strong>USB</strong> <strong>beacon</strong> (small, portable, quick to deploy) — beacons the size of a flash drive for asset tracking and proximity solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Video beacon</strong> — devices plugged into the back of a screen to deliver contextual visual information (for example, a user approaches a display in a food joint and shows personalized offers based on usage of the beacon-enabling app) as well as for digital signage.</li>
<li><strong>AI beacon</strong>. A machine learning-driven device that can detect different movements and gestures.</li>
<li><strong>Sticker beacon </strong>— the smallest of beacons, used for asset tracking.</li>
<li><strong>Parent beacon</strong> (the size of big Wi-Fi routers) is used to track other beacons, gather data and store it in the cloud, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated beacon</strong> — devices resistant to exogenous factors (dust, water, shattering, antistatic and UV) for indoor tracking and proximity solutions in harsh environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the aforementioned beacon types emerged in the years since the inception of beacon technology to accommodate the business needs of different companies, so new ones may come into being in the future, giving companies new options to engage customers.</p>
<h2><strong>What Are Beacons Used For?</strong></h2>
<p>Beacon technology can improve the user experience both at the front and back end of almost any company, helping to streamline operations and gather data, drive sales, and deliver unique user experiences. Still, the retail and marketing industries benefit from beacons the most, as they are almost tailor-made for the two.</p>
<h3><strong>Front &amp; Back End of Business</strong></h3>
<p>At the front end, for example, at a retail store, you can <a href="https://intellectsoft.net/cases/retail-software" rel="noopener noreferrer">pair beacons with a custom app</a> to notify shoppers about limited in-store offers, deliver personalized promotions, and provide navigation at vast retail locations.</p>
<p>At the back end, beacons are as effective. You can set up a beacon-based indoor positioning system at a warehouse to simplify and speed up the indoor navigation in its bigger areas for new employees and representatives of third parties. Paired with an <a href="https://intellectsoft.net/services/enterprise-software-development" rel="noopener noreferrer">enterprise software development</a> solution, beacons also allow for indoor personnel tracking to improve on-premises security as well as asset tracking.</p>
<p>For instance, an employee of a large enterprise needs a new laptop. The system administrator chooses one from the list of available laptops as a sticker beacon on it shows its location.</p>
<h3><strong>Beacons Elevate Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>Today, companies and their marketing teams mostly rely on emerging wireless technologies to cater to and engage customers. Small and hidden beacons have a smaller appeal, but they can have a big impact.</p>
<p>In a standout example, <a href="https://blog.estimote.com/post/156727141740/redbull-partners-with-byborre-cwi-and-nearables" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>RedBull</u></a> used beacon stickers to monitor the movements of audience members at a music event. First, the devices collected different types of data. Then, scientists used it to create algorithms and deep neural networks to understand the movements and energy levels of audience members.</p>
<p>The results were visualized on the walls of a separate room at the venue. RedBull then went further, allowing the audience to take their individual information home as a souvenir, embroidered on a scarf. This is also an example of how beacon technology can be used successfully without a mobile phone app.</p>
<h4><strong>Other Uses in Marketing:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>A new avenue for driving sales</strong>. You can pair beacons with mobile to deliver <a href="https://intellectsoft.net/cases/retail-software" rel="noopener noreferrer">highly personalized location-based ads</a>.</li>
<li><strong>One more way to collect data</strong>. Beacons can gather customer data that will help you create better, more personalized experiences, as well as gain additional insights into customers&#8217; behavior.</li>
<li><strong>New meaningful experiences for customers</strong>. Like RedBull&#8217;s beacon stickers, some types of beacons give a lot of room to experiment and develop creative solutions that your customers will remember for a long time.
<p>Beacons are used in retail settings to send personalized promotions, discounts, and advertisements to customers’ smartphones when they are near a specific product or within a store. Retailers use beacons to guide customers through stores, helping them find products or providing information about sales and special offers.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Other industries that can leverage beacon technology:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare ((patient tracking and safety, and equipment management)</li>
<li>Hospitality (navigation, gamification, smart hotel rooms)</li>
<li>Sports (navigation on big arenas, proximity marketing)</li>
<li>Logistics &amp; warehousing (asset tracking, security)</li>
<li>Transportation (navigation, passenger guidance, vehicle tracking, transit efficiency)</li>
<li>Smart home development (beacons can provide navigations to guests at vast properties; security)</li>
<li>Construction (geofencing perimeters for projects in the middle of nowhere)</li>
<li>Events (gamification, navigation, schedule notifications)</li>
<li>Education (interactive learning, navigation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Video beacons are the go-to example when it comes to showcasing the high value of beacon technology. For example, you can use video beacons to deliver contextual information and provide navigation at a hotel or resort. Such experiences are fresh, save time, and imbue the customer journey with small but memorable moments.</p>
<h2><strong>Beacon Technology: Pros and Cons </strong></h2>
<p>Beacon technology has a wide array of solid business benefits and only a few disadvantages.</p>
<h3><strong>Pros:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low cost</strong>. Standard models are small and made of low-cost materials like plastic, making beacons more cost-effective than other state-of-the-art technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to adopt</strong>. Most beacon devices are quick to deploy. Some, like USB beacons, are as easy to install as a computer mouse. Deploying beacons at scale is also easy with parent beacons.</li>
<li><strong>Tailored-made customer experiences</strong>. Beacon technology allows companies send personalized notifications and ads.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability and scalability</strong>. Beacons are dependable devices: unlike GPS, they use Bluetooth, so thick walls or underground areas will not block their signals. More so, some beacon suppliers offer beacons that are reinforced against exogenous factors.</li>
<li><strong>Vast outreach</strong>. All modern smartphones support beacon technology (your users need iOS 7 or Android 4 or higher installed on their devices), so you can reach out to virtually anyone, anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Easy implementation</strong>. The majority of beacon technology offerings come with a software development kit (SDK) and back end management tools, making it easy to integrate a beacon solution with existing applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Cons:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users may opt-out</strong>. Most beacon-based solutions require user consent. Today, the flow of content from all sides seems endless, and even if you use only a few apps daily, you still get a lot of notifications. In the face of content overload, some users can simply turn off Bluetooth on their smartphones, preferring to miss out on your beacon-based experience, even if it is exciting and non-intrusive.</li>
<li><strong>A mobile app is a must</strong>. In most cases, beacons work only when paired with a mobile app. There are workarounds like third-party applications, but if you want to deliver a smooth experience your customers will definitely enjoy, you will at least need to add a feature to your application.</li>
<li><strong>Creating a beacon solution is not ubiquitously easy</strong>. The use cases of beacon technology are straightforward in the retail and marketing industries. Beacons can also be used effectively by hotels and companies that develop smart room solutions. In other cases, you should get creative or hire a software engineer with expertise in beacon-based or geofencing solutions, and this will take time, more so if your company is a medium-sized business or enterprise that needs a highly scalable solution.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: The Future of Beacons</strong></h2>
<blockquote><p>According to Global Market Insights, the beacon technology market is projected to surpass $25 billion in 2025.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in 2018, Google started sending out free beacons to small businesses across the U.S., helping them stand out to nearby customers. It was a game-changer, and since then, beacons have only gotten smarter. By 2019, Estimote introduced the AI beacon, pushing the boundaries with features like contextual awareness and real-time data processing.</p>
<p>Now, in 2024, beacons are everywhere. They’re guiding travelers through busy airports and train stations, optimizing public transit with real-time vehicle tracking, and providing a non-intrusive, spot-on way to engage with customers in a world overloaded with content.</p>
<p>Taking all this into account, it is safe to assume that more and more business locations will have beacons installed in them in the coming years. Although long-term projections might not reflect reality in the end, there are no visible hurdles on the way of large-scale beacon technology adoption. After all, beacons demand little to invest, are easy to set up and manage regardless of business scale, and bring clear, straightforward benefits to business across industries.

<p><span data-color="transparent">For business leaders, the biggest impact of technology isn&#8217;t on the tech itself (though it&#8217;s very important) but on the people and organizations that use it. As such, digital transformation is a broad description of the long-term technology adoption strategy that shakes up how businesses function and grow. </span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">In this article, we will discuss innovative technologies, how to adopt them wisely, and the latest digital transformation trends driving business changes today; let&#8217;s get started. </span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">It&#8217;s clear to everyone that digital transformation is</span> not just a buzzword but<span data-color="transparent"> fundamental reality for businesses today.

<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong><span data-color="transparent">Why To Enter Digital Transformation And Adopt New Technology? </span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-color="transparent">For</span> digital leaders in<span data-color="transparent"> many businesses, the answer is straightforward: to stay competitive, streamline workflow operations, respond faster to clients</span> and customer demand<span data-color="transparent">, and scale. With the rapid development of technologies, it seems almost imperative for companies to adopt and implement them to enhance their services</span> and customer relationships<span data-color="transparent">.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Businesses today should innovate and adapt, leading them to rethink their models to make the most of digital technologies. Whether you&#8217;re a small business or a large enterprise, integrating digital technologies into your operations opens up many opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/digital-transformation-services">Digital transformation</a> is happening everywhere—from finance, machinery, media, and government to culture and healthcare. It helps organizations rethink old ways and adopt new, innovative practices.</span></p>
<h2><span data-color="transparent">Digital Transformation Strategies </span></h2>
<p>Creating a digital transformation plan is just one part of the successful digital business transformation process, but going through successful digital transformation alone without one is a lost cause.</p>
<p>Digital transformation strategy is about where to play and also about where not to play. It applies to the tech strategy of your organization and requires careful analysis, planning, and execution. We encourage you to revisit your company&#8217;s business strategy. Consider what you want to achieve, your objectives, where to play, and which technology to use and, importantly, not use.</p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">We have broken down the roadmap into stages and defined three of them. You can customize them and use them to build a digital transformation framework. </span></p>
<p><strong>Consider outlining these three main stages and dividing them into smaller steps in the roadmap to make the process smoother:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-color="transparent">Stage 1: Defining objectives and value. This important stage involves defining your business goals for the upcoming years. Securing senior management and other stakeholders for upcoming tech projects is another everyday companion. It&#8217;s also recommended that everyone in the organization stay engaged through questionnaires/ workshops/ surveys. Your employees know the process and may define challenges and needs faster. Moreover, such an environment brings a spirit of unity and encourages your teams to innovate in the company. </span></li>
<li><span data-color="transparent">Stage 2: This stage requires a strategic approach. Begin by identifying lighthouse projects that will kickstart your digital transformation. Once these projects are tested and optimized, you can continue to expand your transformation efforts. </span><em>Assemble a team of skilled professionals and involve your tech partners if you outsource your IT needs. Allocate the necessary resources, such as technology and personnel, and focus on building and implementing the technology. Consider adopting new agile methods to enhance organizational efficiency.</em></li>
<li><span data-color="transparent">Stage 3: Scaling up. From now on, continuously upgrade your technologies as they develop and offer new features and capabilities. In addition to technology, undergo training for your employees; it helps them acquire new skills faster and much more effectively. Adopting the new operating model is the last thing to include in the roadmap.</span></li>

<h3><b>Enhanced Competitive Advantage</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Banking empowers businesses to create services that deeply connect with customer needs, often surpassing what traditional banks can offer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By leveraging these APIs, startups can access a wealth of data that facilitates innovations such as investment forecasts, personalized advice, and custom-made products tailored to specific customer segments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, this integration provides startups with agility, enabling them to adapt to market changes while effortlessly adhering to evolving regulations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Transaction Standardization</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a common ground for financial transactions allows various banking systems and software to work together seamlessly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes life easier for startups who are looking to grow and move into new areas, as they don&#8217;t have to worry about the usual obstacles of making sure everything works together or meets specific rules.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Open Banking API Use Cases</span><span style="font-weight: 800;"> in FinTech</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From simplifying audits to facilitating payment systems, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Banking API</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has become a transformative force across many sectors of the </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/solutions/financial-software-development-services"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few real-world case studies detailing how the Open Banking framework has been harnessed to create successful fintech enterprises.</span></p>
<h3><b>Case Study 1: Enhancing Audit Efficiency with Circit</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/insights/how-audit-platform-circit-uses-open-banking-to-streamline-financial-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has aimed to make the auditing process easier. By embracing Open Banking technology, this audit evidence platform allows faster verification of financial information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, audits could be slow and filled with manual tasks that took a lot of time to complete. Now, thanks to Circit&#8217;s use of cutting-edge Open Banking APIs, auditors can quickly check financial assets straight from banks as they happen—meaning more accurate results and lower chances for mistakes or fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This modern approach has made a real difference. With Circit&#8217;s system, what used to take weeks now only takes days, slashing the amount of work involved by half. It’s a smarter way of doing things that’s helping everyone involved in auditing breathe a little easier.</span></p>
<h3><b>Case Study 2: Improving Donation Processes with Wonderful’s Direct Payment System</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/insights/wonderfuls-a2a-platform-offers-cost-effective-payment-processing-for-small-firms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wonderful Payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, originally a platform aiding charity fundraising efforts, confronted the issue of steep card processing fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They sought to alleviate this financial burden by adopting a direct bank transfer method known as account-to-account (A2A) payments. This strategic move allowed charities to collect contributions without enduring hefty charges, thus fostering greater openness in handling funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embracing Open Banking principles aligns perfectly with Wonderful&#8217;s commitment to not charge charities any fees and offers small enterprises an economical payment alternative that cuts down on expenses and quickens the pace of transactions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Case Study 3: Expanding Loan Access with AperiData’s Credit Console</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/insights/aperidatas-credit-console-expands-access-to-loans-for-hey-credit-union-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HEY Credit Union</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has revamped its loan approval process by leveraging banking APIs in partnership with AperiData. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The innovative Credit Console, by AperiData utilizes the Open Banking APIs to deliver time insights. The integration means the credit union can expedite and enhance the accuracy of its lending decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This collaboration has notably boosted the approval rates of loans for amounts as it offers a more holistic view of an applicant&#8217;s financial status compared to traditional credit assessments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By identifying risks and spending trends, the system ensures that loans are extended responsibly and better understands the borrower’s financial circumstances.</span></p>
<h3><b>Case Study 4: Little Birdie’s App Simplifies Subscription Management for Consumers</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/insights/little-birdie-subscription-app-helps-drive-better-money-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little Birdie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a subscription management app, has smartly leveraged the benefits of an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Banking payment API</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to tackle the issue many UK consumers face with managing their subscriptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This platform allows individuals to easily keep an eye on, handle, and even cancel various subscriptions from one central place. It effectively addresses the common problem where people forget about ongoing payments that can quietly drain their finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By linking directly with users&#8217; bank accounts through Open Banking technology, Little Birdie swiftly spots recurring expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature is particularly helpful at a time when every penny counts due to rising living costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users who find themselves paying for services they no longer need or use can cut these out or swap them for more affordable alternatives which could lead to significant savings each year.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Technical Aspects of Open Banking: How Does It Work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve discussed, Open Banking relies on an Application Programming Interface (API). These act like bridges that allow different financial services and apps to talk to each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of it as a secure postal service for your financial data: It delivers information where it needs to go, but only after checking the right levels of permission are in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technical backbone of these connections is known as RESTful APIs. These are built specifically for the web so they can seamlessly handle requests, whether you’re asking for data (that’s a</span><b> GET</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), sending new details (a</span><b> POST</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), updating existing info (with</span><b> PUT</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), or removing data (using</span><b> DELETE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all operates under strict Open Banking standards which make sure everyone speaks the same language when sharing and accessing this kind of sensitive information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is essential if we want our various financial tools to work together smoothly. For instance, managing bank accounts through a single app without any hiccups along the way.</span></p>
<h3><b>Security and Compliance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with any banking, ensuring security is critical, and Opening Banking is no exception. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Banking API security</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> measures are comprehensive – they include OAuth to confirm identities, HTTPS to establish secure channels of communication, and end-to-end encryption to safeguard data privacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further strengthen these defenses, strict access guidelines are in place alongside vigilant monitoring to preempt any potential threats. Matching steps with stringent international regulations like </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/consumer-finance-and-payments/payment-services_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSD2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the European Union underscores this commitment to rigorously protecting user information.</span></p>
<h3><b>Blueprint of an </b><b>Open Banking API</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Banking API specification</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serves as the framework that establishes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Banking API standards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and operational guidelines crucial for collaboration between different entities in this ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It explicitly defines the data formats to be utilized, provides definitions for each API endpoint interaction, and standardizes error resolution approaches across platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These measures are essentially put in place to facilitate productive cooperation, among all parties involved.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">First Steps to </span><span style="font-weight: 800;">Open API Banking</span><span style="font-weight: 800;">: What You Need to Know?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting the process of embracing Open Banking APIs can lead to positive changes for FinTech firms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the initial steps is essential. Below is a roadmap to kick off and tactically organize for an incorporation.</span></p>
<h3><b>Getting Started</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing to do when getting started with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open API Banking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to grasp the tech and regulatory landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This involves getting familiar with the standards for Open Banking APIs established by bodies that are in place to ensure security and data privacy. </span></p>
<h3><b>Choose an Open Banking Provider</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next important step is choosing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Banking API providers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s crucial to opt for providers that do not adhere to these standards but cater to your specific business requirements. Seek out </span><a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/regulated-providers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulated providers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> known for their security protocols, uptime, and reliable support systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure you comply with global regulations like </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR in Europe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCPA in California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also vital. This compliance plays a role in fostering trust with your users by protecting their information.</span></p>
<h3><b>Strategic Planning</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have laid down the groundwork it&#8217;s essential to engage in planning for incorporating an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Banking API</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin by outlining the scope of API integration in your services. Determine which features you want to improve or introduce using banking data. Consider </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/it-consulting-services"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conducting a feasibility study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to evaluate the financial aspects of the integration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a phased rollout strategy that involves testing with a group of users to gather feedback and make adjustments before launching on a larger scale. This step-by-step approach helps in reducing risks and ensures an efficient integration process.</span></p>
<h3><b>Maintenance </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, be prepared for maintenance and updates as Open Banking environments are constantly evolving. Regular updates to APIs and compliance standards are typical, so it&#8217;s essential to stay informed and adaptable.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Summing Up</span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In today’s fast-paced world, both small companies and large enterprises need to stay on their toes and quickly adapt to the latest changes to remain competitive with the latest developments in their industry. Embracing and weaving current trends into your workflow is a key to success in the digital age.</p>
<p>The quicker and smarter you respond to changes, the better your chances of future success. Staying up-to-date with trends can help you attract more customers and boost revenue. Many companies are currently undergoing digital transformations. But what does that mean, and how can it benefit your business?</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the details of this topic.</p>
<p>Digital transformation means blending digital technology into the company’s core. Though the term is mainly relevant to business, it also falls under government, mass media, culture, medicine, science, and many other industries. Simply put, it’s a big strategic change that affects company operations and how to elevate the customer experience. Digital transformation is also a synonym for “paperless,” meaning that all the data is digitalized and stored in the company’s system.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-21150 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-1024x683.jpg" alt="What Is Digital Transformation" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Implementing these solutions in your business will affect every department, and all the operations carried out within the company. It will change the way your company functions internally and externally. Thus, successfully undergoing digital transformation will bring value to the overall business workflow and customer experience by rethinking existing business processes to meet evolving market and customer demands now.</p>
<h2><span data-color="transparent">Examples of Digital Transformation: You&#8217;ve Already Seen Them</span></h2>
<p>Digital transformation is evident everywhere. While some companies adapt more slowly, the shift is inevitable. It’s a smart move and one of the more significant strategies for staying competitive. Various industries have successfully implemented digital technologies to enhance customer experiences and streamline operations, showcasing numerous digital transformation examples.</p>
<p>Have you seen Nike’s latest technology? Nike has embraced direct-to-consumer sales through its client-facing apps, leveraging its website and mobile app for personalized shopping experiences.</p>
<p>Nike uses data analytics and AI to predict trends and manage inventory, ensuring popular products are always available. With Nike Fit, the company employs machine learning to measure foot size accurately, helping customers find the perfect fit. They’re also optimizing their supply chain with IoT devices and predictive analytics.</p>
<p>You can find examples of digital transformation everywhere nowadays, impacting nearly every aspect of human activity.</p>
<h2><span data-color="transparent">What&#8217;s the Difference Between Digital Transformation and Business Transformation?</span></h2>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Speaking of business and digital transformations, the first term, &#8220;business transformation,&#8221; is broader. It encompasses various transformations.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">All companies must undergo a business transformation at some point to stay current with rapidly evolving trends, improve services, streamline workflows, and enhance customer communication.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">&#8220;Business transformation&#8221; mainly means changes at all stages in every department. These &#8220;transformations&#8221; consist of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Digital transformation:</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> Aimed at improving customer interactions and internal organization.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">IT functional transformation:</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> Focused on optimizing the work within the IT department.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Enterprise transformation:</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> Concentrated on how work is done throughout the entire company.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">In other words, business transformation calls for adopting new business models that align with modern market demands. Digital transformation, on the other hand, is about implementing the tools and solutions necessary to make these new strategies effective. It improves business-to-customer interactions, business-to-business cooperation, and internal company operations (business-to-employee).</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">For example, in the healthcare sector, digital transformation focuses on technological tools and solutions to address operational challenges, ultimately achieving the broader goals of business transformation.</span></p>
<h2><span data-color="transparent">The Digital Transformation Strategy Roadmap</span></h2>
<p>Entering a digital transformation journey involves several key stages that require careful planning and execution. You can start building a roadmap when you set a digital transformation framework. Remember that three main stages should be outlined and divided into smaller steps in the roadmap to make it easier:</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1</strong>: Defining value. This stage involves securing senior management. It’s the first step. Ensure that everyone in the company is engaged and actively participates. Gather board meetings with management and different departments of the company to define the goals of the transformation. Make them challenging and motivating. The last in this stage is the budget. Allocate funds for the resources and technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2</strong>: Launching and maintaining. It requires a strategic approach. Start by identifying lighthouse projects to start the digital transformation projects. Once these projects are tested and optimized, you can proceed with related projects to continue the transformation. Assemble a team of high-profile professionals with the necessary skills. Consider implementing new agile methods for work organization.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3</strong>: Scaling up. From now on, continuously upgrade your technologies as they develop and offer new features and capabilities. In addition to technology, it’s important that your employees undergo training; it helps them acquire new skills faster and much more effectively. Adopting the new operating model is the last thing to include in the roadmap.</p>

<p><a href="https://intellectsoft.net/services/digital-transformation-services" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital transformation is necessary for businesses in different industries</a> because of all the emerging digital technologies. These technologies change the way companies function and organize their work. They help deliver a better user experience and generate more revenue for the business. Staying informed about the digital transformation technologies and trends like AI and robotic process automation can significantly improve digital transformation strategies and help meet the needs of both employees and customers.</p>
<p>We oversee certain tendencies in the technology used for the <a href="https://intellectsoft.net/bloggg/why-enterprises-need-digital-transformation" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital transformation of the enterprise</a>; this list includes:</p>
<h3><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></h3>
<p>Many companies consider cloud computing the first to-go technology when entering a company’s path of digital transformation. There are many good reasons for this. Overall, it improves internal and external processes, operations, and services. With its infrastructure, platforms, and computing abilities, cloud computing helps you stay agile in your business field. Considering this, cloud computing is cost- and labor-effective, and what is important to mention is that it is secure (you can omit system shutdowns and create several backups). Two more important things come with cloud computing: scale and speed. These two are necessary to win the competition in the market.</p>
<h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)</strong></h3>
<p>When properly used, AI and ML can help businesses earn additional income and reduce time spent executing day-to-day activities. With ML, you can analyze big and complex data and make accurate decisions based on available information. Minimize risks in production and create personalized experiences for your clients using AI. Thanks to these technologies, there is less room for errors and more for impeccable, high-quality service.</p>
<h3><strong>Blockchain</strong></h3>
<p>Blockchain is a powerful asset for companies heading toward digital transformation. This technology facilitates transactions, eliminating third parties and making it easier and more transparent for partner businesses and clients. It would be mistaken to think that only finance and banking companies can use this technology. Now, you can find blockchain integration in diverse industries such as retail, supply chain, healthcare, and telecommunications. And this list doesn’t end. We expect to see more usage of this technology in the coming future.</p>
<h3><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong></h3>
<p>Augmented Reality is a real game-changer. It changes the departments’ operational activities and enhances the company’s competitiveness in the market. AR opens opportunities that once were hard to imagine, such as looking inside objects (machines, bodies) without opening them, examining and detecting them, and giving a full report with a description of the problem found inside. AR is applicable for product development, maintenance, and safety measures.</p>
<h3><strong><span data-color="transparent">Internet of Things (IoT)</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Over the last few years, we&#8217;ve seen another giant trend: IoT. This technology brings many benefits to the business. For instance, you can use the data collected with the help of IoT to understand your customers and their needs better and, as a result, offer them better services. Also, IoT can help you polish your segmentation strategy and expand your target audience. It can also improve employee productivity and reduce costs.</span></p>
<h3><span data-color="transparent">Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</span></h3>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Imagine having a digital assistant who takes care of all those repetitive and mundane tasks that consume your time, like data entry or invoice processing. That&#8217;s exactly what Robotic Process Automation (RPA) does! By automating these routine activities, RPA boosts operational efficiency and accuracy and frees up your human resources to focus on more strategic, value-added activities. It&#8217;s like having an extra set of hands that never gets tired, making your business runsmoother and smarter.</span></p>
<h3><span data-color="transparent">Mobile Technology</span></h3>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Those days when mobile phones were just for calls and texts are long gone! Today, mobile technology is everywhere, and it has changed the way we live and do business. From mobile tickets and wallets to entirely new business models like Uber, our dependence on mobile devices has greatly driven digital transformation.</span> Mobile technologies and<span data-color="transparent"> apps make everything possible, from ordering dinner from a favorite restaurant to managing banking and investments. Now, it&#8217;s all about convenience and staying connected all the time anywhere.</span></p>
<h3><span data-color="transparent">Digitization</span></h3>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Digitization is the process of converting paper-based information into digital formats. It revolutionizes industries like healthcare with electronic medical records (EMR) and government services by making public records accessible online. Digitization is the backbone of transformation</span> and digital initiatives everywhere<span data-color="transparent">. It makes information more accessible, manageable, and secure, paving the way for a more efficient and connected world.</span></p>
<h3><span data-color="transparent">Digital Twins</span></h3>
<p><span data-color="transparent">With digital twins, you can now experiment with a replica of your physical products or environments to find the best ways to improve efficiency or effectiveness. For instance, a manufacturer can create a digital twin of their shop floor to imagine where to place machinery for better output or safety. Similarly, product manufacturers can design digital replicas to improve ergonomics or usability. This game-changing technology allows organizations to improve their processes without disrupting existing operations.</span></p>

<p>With all the ambition, digital transformation is impossible to complete in one day. Instead, it’s a continuous process that involves a ton of work and effort. Significant investments in digital transformation efforts are necessary to improve operations and customer interactions. It requires careful planning and execution to ensure successful business outcomes. Like all processes, digital transformation involves several stages. We encourage you to get back to your company’s <a href="https://intellectsoft.net/bloggg/what-is-digital-transformation-strategy" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy</a>. Consider what you want to achieve, your objectives, where to play, and which technology to use and, importantly, not use.</p>
<p>Creating a plan is just one part of the process, but going digital without one is a lost cause.</p>
<p>Use these steps as a guide to the digital transformation process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Analyze the environment within and outside the company. It is important to understand where you stand and your strengths and weaknesses. Check how your competitors are dealing with similar problems.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Set transformation objectives. What do you want to see as the final result? What is the company’s goal? Which operations, departments, or processes do you think are worth renovating? Answer these questions before proceeding to the next stages of the process. Involve your employees in the process. They can provide valuable insights and point out potential issues from their daily activities.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose the right technology and outline the budget. When considering the technology, don’t underestimate thorough research. The future technology should suit the needs of your company, employees, and clients. Communicate with the vendor and set close relationships for further collaboration, as support of the system is as important as its development or implementation. Make sure the technology is scalable to continue growing even if some elements need maintenance or re-engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Create a clear roadmap for the process and prioritize the activities. Access the company’s capabilities, resources, and budget, identify changes, and do a cost-benefit analysis. Then, logically prioritize activities.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Identify and train your team. Choose employees and create teams that can implement new technology. Show all the changes that you plan to make to the employees. It is important to educate your staff so they will be well-prepared once the new system is ready.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Implement the changes. This step includes running tests, ongoing maintenance, and adding necessary changes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Continuously undergo support for the new technologies. Use new features to stay up to date and increase the system and services’ performance.</p>
<h2><strong><span data-color="transparent">Benefits of Digital Transformation:</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> How Is It Useful for Your Business?</span></h2>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Considering the information above, we can highlight several benefits of digital transformation. Although the process can be time-consuming and require many resources, the advantages it offers cover the expenses and greatly increase business value.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">So, what are the benefits we get with the digital transformation of business?</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-color="transparent">There will be less manual work as operations and processes are automized, making the overall work more efficient and almost flawless;</span></li>
<li><span data-color="transparent">Reduced time spent on day-to-day activities;</span></li>
<li><span data-color="transparent">The client&#8217;s satisfaction will grow. It follows from the benefits listed above. Flawless and quick service will win the hearts of your clients and more likely make them your regular customers;</span></li>
<li><span data-color="transparent">Another important advantage is increased revenue. Reduced time and errors save your funds; loyal clients will bring more revenue.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-color="transparent">These are four significant benefits of digital transformation for small and large businesses. Of course, this list is not complete, as all businesses are different, and each will find something unique.</span></p>
<h2><span data-color="transparent">How to Measure ROI on Digital Transformation?</span></h2>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Digital transformation is an ongoing process of change that never stops. Measuring ROI is an important step in defining the effectiveness of your digital transformation initiatives. Make sure your company is well-equipped for the dynamic tech environment. From then on, your</span> digital business always<span data-color="transparent"> adapts, upgrades, and constantly responds to innovative tech trends. Assessing ROI is important to see if your business is moving along the right path.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">At the start, each company </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/14/the-roi-of-digital-transformation#522607545a22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-color="transparent">may measure ROI</span></a><span data-color="transparent"> in its own way, as objectives and metrics can differ. However, there are some common steps to ease the way and see if your digital metamorphosis is compelling.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-color="transparent">Step 1. Establish Your Goals</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">There are many reasons why it&#8217;s essential to define your objectives.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">First is because it will directly impact the metrics of your ROI. Consider your company&#8217;s specific challenges, requirements, and cultural values. Some businesses may need to increase operational agility, while others may chase it to boost customer experience. At this step, ensure that</span> business leaders and<span data-color="transparent"> all the senior management are headed in the same direction and share similar values. At this stage, ensure that all senior management is aligned and shares similar values. This alignment will prevent chaos and confusion from a lack of clear goals.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-color="transparent">Step 2. Pick Metrics that Align Your Goals</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Depending on what you aim to achieve, you will determine how to measure it. For instance, if your goal is to enhance customer experience, you might measure the number of return customers, monitor brand awareness, or assess net promoter scores. Suppose you plan to adopt a digital workplace. In that case, you may want to track the number of applications your employees switch between and evaluate whether this affects efficiency or causes distractions that lead to errors.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-color="transparent">Step 3. Get Down to Measuring Business</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">With a clear set of objectives and an allocated budget to reach them, you can begin evaluating the results. This involves examining whether your current state aligns with your desired objectives. The chosen metrics will be tools for measuring progress, even if the goals initially seem abstract.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">To illustrate this, let&#8217;s consider an example of measuring ROI within the HR department of a large organization, as presented by Forbes. Suppose they aim to automate the vacation request process to increase operational efficiency. Now, the manual process takes 75 hours of employee time each month. Appropriate digital tools can reduce this time to 15 hours per month. The goal is clear and measurable, making it easy to see if you&#8217;ve hit the mark. By estimating the ROI of this objective, you can get a better sense of the bigger picture and evaluate the overall efficiency of the digital changes.</span></p>
<h2><span data-color="transparent">Top KPIs to Measure Your Success</span></h2>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are the compass that will guide your digital metamorphosis. Tracking these KPIs is essential for ensuring a successful digital transformation. KPIs are the lighthouse that helps you see if you&#8217;re navigating in the right direction or need to change course to achieve business growth.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">There are no one-size-fits-all instructions for</span> any successful digital transformation strategies<span data-color="transparent">. However, here are some key areas to anchor your focus.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">This indicator will show if your money to attract new customers aligns with your objectives and budget. It&#8217;s one of the essential gauges during the digital transformation process, as it shows the cost-effectiveness of your tech solutions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Customer Satisfaction and Retention</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://salesforce.com/research/customer-expectations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-color="transparent">76% of customers </span></a><span data-color="transparent">believe that companies should understand their</span> customer expectations,<span data-color="transparent"> and needs. Measuring customer satisfaction and retention is like checking the pulse of your business to see if you&#8217;re meeting client demands with your new digital mindset. You can track this through customer satisfaction scores or the percentage of repeat purchases.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Net Promoter Score (NPS)</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Determining NPS is important for seeing long-term business growth influenced by transformation. Simply put, you want to know if your customers would recommend your company to a friend. Regular surveys can help you monitor whether this number is on the rise.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Percentage of Product Defects</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">One of the key goals of automation through digital transformation is to reduce errors from manual operations. It&#8217;s important to evaluate if the AI or ML solutions you&#8217;ve implemented are truly effective. Measure this KPI by taking the number of faulty products, the total number produced, and seeing if the defect rate decreases with new digital solutions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Revenue Growth Rate</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Likely, one of the most desired KPIs. This metric shows the speed at which your business income is growing. The goal is to boost revenue quickly, as it&#8217;s the lifeline of any venture. Achieving revenue growth requires attracting new customers and ensuring past customers return.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Process Downtime Level</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">This indicator is valuable for companies automating processes and operations. It reveals if the time lost due to tech problems or employee absences has decreased thanks to new tech solutions.</span></p>
<h2 id="widt9">What Are the Challenges of Digital Transformation?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21155" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-1024x684.jpg" alt="Challenges of Digital Transformation" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-1000x668.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">While 85% of enterprise decision-makers believe they have a limited time frame of two years for successful in-depth digital transformation, many view this metamorphosis as daunting and quite challenging. Digital transformation leaders play a central role in guiding organizations through these challenges. So, what are the major issues a business may face during this transformation process?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Finding common grounds at every level of an organization</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Undergoing transformation cannot be done in a silo. This process requires cross-functional effort. So, keep all the departments, both leaders and employees involved. One effective way to find common ground is to gather feedback from all departments and ensure that employees share the values of a new digital mindset.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Integrating legacy and digital assets</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">One of the main challenges is overcoming doubts about whether a business needs new tech tools when it has already invested heavily in its legacy programming. The transformation aims to link the</span> many legacy systems<span data-color="transparent"> with new digital tools and scale up the existing technology to improve the business.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Facing digital change fears</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">The overload of tech-savvy solutions may intimidate employees. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to invest time in training them to work with new technology. Their fears will disappear once workers see that advanced technology helps them do their jobs and become more efficient.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Managing risks of digital infrastructure</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">With new opportunities come new risks. On the one hand, each employee-owned device is a portal into a corporate</span> digital data<span data-color="transparent"> store. On the other hand, digital tools allow a company to reinforce data security. Digitized security systems ensure that online assets are better protected, and cloud computing risks are more accessible to identify and handle.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Getting lost trying to keep up with all the current trends</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">The last but not least challenge is to avoid getting lost in a chaotic bouncing from one trend to another. That is why the only way to overcome this hurdle is to have a well-thought-out framework for your transformation. To avoid getting stuck in the mish-mash of solutions trying to keep up with the ever-changing digital environment, you&#8217;ll need to have a blueprint and always focus on the final goal.</span></p>
<h2><span data-color="transparent">Digital Transformation Framework: The Guidelines</span></h2>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Well-defined digital transformation strategies are essential for navigating the complexities. With no plan, a company is doomed to get trapped in the middle of digital metamorphosis, as it is only possible to adapt to new technology and trends appearing daily with a strict outline of actions.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">For this reason, before getting down to business, any organization needs to set up a digital transformation framework that will both serve as a guideline and always keep the focus on the final goal.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">There is no existing one-size-fits-all framework businesses can apply to, as every company outlines a plan specific to its needs, requirements, and values.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">As the digital changing process is not indivisible, there are four basic frameworks that you can customize for your company:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Processes and Operations</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Some companies want to boost customer experience, lower production costs, or increase quality. The objectives may be various, though the means to achieve them can be clearly defined. Incorporating new technology may significantly enhance a company&#8217;s processes and operations.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">For instance, Airbus uses display glasses to improve the quality of employees inspecting the planes. Domino&#8217;s Pizza enables the order process from any device, thus overtaking Pizza Hut in sales.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">While the goals are different—Airbus focuses on enhancing the quality and safety of its products, while Domino&#8217;s aims to improve customer experience and increase sales—the means are the same: transforming old processes and operations with new tech solutions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Business Model Transformation</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">This area of transformation requires a fresh outlook on how value is delivered in the industry and within your company. Examples include Netflix reimagining its business model from an outdated DVD rental company to a leading media-services provider and production company.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Another example is Apple reinventing music delivery with iTunes.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">As you&#8217;ve probably noticed, all the verbs have the prefix&#8217; re,&#8217; indicating that companies take their existing models andopen new opportunities for business growth by repeatedly launching fresh initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Changing how a company delivers value to users and customers requires strong leadership, active involvement, and well-thought-out strategic planning from the Strategy and Business departments. It also needs the courage to take risks on the path to something new.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Domain Transformation</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">The allure of digital transformation is that with its endless opportunities, the sky is the limit. A business can successfully create a new source of revenue by venturing into an entirely new industry. Take Amazon, for example. They boldly entered a new market by launching Amazon Web Services (AWS), offering cloud computing services. This was remarkable, as IT giants like Microsoft and IBM predominantly owned the domain. However, the unique opportunities of tech solutions, their strong digital capabilities, and exceptionally brave thinking have enabled AWS now to contribute 60% of Amazon&#8217;s annual profit.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">It goes without saying that companies like Amazon are better able to leverage new technology and expand into new domains more quickly. Still, technologies like AI, ML, UX, IoT, and AR show that a business can unlock new growth cost-effectively and efficiently. Therefore, explore new domains and see whether your company can benefit from these unlocked opportunities</span> for competitive advantage<span data-color="transparent">.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Cultural and Organization Transformation</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Many companies focus on cultural change by adopting digital values without making real changes</span> to business culture<span data-color="transparent">. To transform, change your company culture, and embrace new skills and technologies.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">You need solid and clear initiatives to update workflows and bring in new value by changing old habits. Teaching employees about decentralized decision-making is only worthwhile if they feel heard. Similarly, manual tasks should only be replaced if the new automated processes are actually better.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">In short, cultural change alone won&#8217;t drive business success. However, when combined with effective tech solutions, it can lead to continuous growth. So, when planning cultural changes, ensure they&#8217;re part of a bigger digital transformation strategy.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Digital transformation has quickly gone from an unknown term to a buzzword. Technologies like Cloud Computing, IoT, Blockchain, AI, and AR are now part of everyday business language and operations. Yet, figuring out the right path for your business can still be confusing.</span></p>

<h2><span data-color="transparent">Future of Digital Transformation: What Is Next?</span></h2>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Each digital transformation initiative will need to adapt to emerging technologies</span>, change management,<span data-color="transparent"> and market demands. We already know the benefits of digital transformation and can only imagine how it will evolve as technologies continuously upgrade and acquire new features.</span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">While digital transformation has predominantly affected the IT and financial sectors, its potential extends far beyond.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to migrate your existing on-prem systems to the cloud isn’t one to take lightly. With over </span><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/bloggg/corporate-cloud-data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60% of corporate data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now located in cloud-based systems, cloud migration is quickly becoming the norm and brings a unique set of challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legacy systems that refuse to budge, data that needs babysitting, and legal challenges such as data sovereignty are just a few of the speed bumps you’ll likely face—but seamless migration is possible with planning and foresight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you use AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, this guide will walk you through the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best practices for cloud migration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that keep your costs low, headaches to a minimum, and your sanity intact.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Cloud Migration Planning</span><span style="font-weight: 800;"> and Preparation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, one in three attempts at cloud data migration fail. In fact, 75% of businesses end up blowing way past the intended budget, and 38% exceed the expected completion timeline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cloud-migration-opportunity-business-value-grows-but-missteps-abound"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scary numbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Planning and preparing are the only ways to ensure your migration efforts don’t become part of these statistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving off-prem and into the cloud requires a lot of careful groundwork and strategy. The planning and preparation stage is your initial roadmap and is created specifically to </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/cloud-migration-risks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent typical gotchas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while keeping business objectives and uptime in mind.</span></p>
<h3><b>Assessing Cloud Migration Readiness</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can start, you’ll need to take a moment to size up your current operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the full extent of what cloud migration entails begins with a meticulous examination of your present infrastructure setup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what it will look like:</span></p>
<h4><b>Evaluate Existing Infrastructure</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin by cataloging your on-premise landscape. Which systems are operating, and how do they interact? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking this step is essential as it allows for the identification of snags and informs decisions about necessary adjustments. Consistent adherence to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud migration best practices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can pave the way for a frictionless shift.</span></p>
<h4><b>Prioritize Applications and Servers</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every application holds the same value or complexity level. Sifting through them meticulously will show you which should head to the front line based on strategic significance, intricacy, as well as anticipated advantages of making such moves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aim to complete early stages with straightforward yet impactful applications. These initial successes foster confidence and set the pace for future ventures.</span></p>
<h4><b>Develop a Comprehensive Migration Plan</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your migration plan is more than just an itinerary. It outlines each part of your migration journey while being mindful of dependencies along with potential stumbling blocks en route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embracing increments rather than immediately overhauling everything tends to yield better results—think precision over haste here.</span></p>
<h3><b>Developing a </b><b>Cloud Migration Strategy</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constructing a sound </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud migration strategy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the cornerstone of a seamless transition to the cloud. Here is an outline for forging such a plan with efficacy:</span></p>
<h4><b>Define a Clear Strategy</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud migration techniques and formats aren’t set in stone. In fact, they’re quite fluid depending on the unique structure your on-prem systems already take. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your setup, there are several pathways that form the basis of your overall migration strategy. These are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Life and Shift</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Quick and straightforward, this approach is ideal for migrating applications that require minimal intervention and changes. It’s cost-effective and reduces the time required to implement the change. However, larger and more complex infrastructure generally cannot be migrated this way.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Rearchitect: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more time-consuming process, this strategy is suited for more complex environments where existing on-prem applications and services are redesigned to fully take advantage of cloud capabilities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Hybrid Approach</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sometimes, on-prem systems just cannot be migrated. In the real world, legacy systems, security compliance, and low local latency requirements just won’t allow it. This strategy combines on-premises and cloud environments, providing a more flexible option.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not the 2010s anymore, and a pure on-premises environment is pretty rare, save for mission-critical infrastructure or when data sovereignty compliance (keeping data contained within a geographic location) is crucial. </span></p>
<h4><b>Establish a Baseline</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retaining local latency can be one of the biggest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud migration challenges</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Users are used to a certain speed and processing time, and you’ll need to maintain (or improve) it. Establish a performance baseline that will allow you to compare the pre-migration and post-migration metrics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you understand your current performance, you’ll help identify areas for improvement and address existing issues at the same time.</span></p>
<h4><b>Identify and Address Risks</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best practices of cloud migration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strategy is identifying all potential risks early on. Factors such as data loss, downtimes, security breaches, and just unhappy users should all form the framework of your initial strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a migration strategy that addresses these risks head-on. As new issues arise—which they will—update the risk management plan as you move along.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Choosing the Right Cloud Provider</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing a provider to host your data and applications in the cloud is a decision that should align with your business goals and objectives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selection of the provider is a core point in your migration strategy, so research what is available and how to manage migration to their services.</span></p>

<h4><b>Focus on Security and Compliance</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an array of security instruments at your disposal, including AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can tightly regulate access within your digital domain. For defending against unwelcome traffic onslaughts, turn to AWS Shield for DDoS and VPN protection.</span></p>
<h4><b>Keep an Eye on Your Spending</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets are strategic partners that provide valuable insight into where every penny goes. By embedding this financial intelligence into your broader strategy, informed decision-making becomes second nature.</span></p>
<h4><b>Embrace Optimization</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage with AWS Trusted Advisor not just as a tool but as a consultant offering tailored advice aimed at refining cost efficiency, enhancing performance metrics, securing system integrity, and ensuring resilience—all in real-time.</span></p>
<h3><b>Azure Cloud Migration Best Practices</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Azure stands out, especially if your enterprise is already nestled in the Microsoft ecosystem. So when shifting gears towards Azure, consider these strategies:</span></p>
<h4><b>Linking with Microsoft Tools</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The synergy between Azure and fellow Microsoft products like Office 365 or Active Directory can simplify your workflow. Harness Azure Active Directory for managing user access and lean on Azure Security Center to keep a vigilant eye on security across all services.</span></p>
<h4><b>Adhering to Standards</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the legal dance of compliance certifications, rest assured that Azure has its bases covered. Moreover, tools such as Azure Policy act as gatekeepers ensuring resources stay aligned with both corporate standards and regulatory demands.</span></p>
<h4><b>Embracing Hybrid Possibilities</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re looking at a setup that combines both local servers and cloud services, then take note of what the hybrid capabilities via Azure Stack bring to your table—think flexibility paired with control right where you need it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Google Cloud Migration Best Practices</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strengths of the Google Cloud Platform aren&#8217;t exactly secret, especially when it comes to pushing the envelope in data analytics and machine learning prowess. If you&#8217;re considering lifting your digital assets into GCP&#8217;s welcoming clouds, here’s how you can execute that move:</span></p>
<h4><b>Data Analytics</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitalize on the muscle of Google BigQuery for heavyweight data analysis or give your machine learning ambitions wings with Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine.</span></p>
<h4><b>Security</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace peace of mind through GCP’s robust security framework. Think iron-clad encryption as standard issue, meticulous identity management systems, and a trust policy that keeps skepticism at its core.</span></p>
<h4><b>Cost Optimization</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage with Committed Use Contracts for sharp cost reductions on steady workloads and not forgetting to tap into the pricing calculator from Google for informed financial forecasting prior to liftoff.</span></p>
<h3><b>Things to Consider When Selecting a Cloud Provider</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the cloud provider depends on your specific system requirements and the applications you are currently using. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Azure could be an option if you are operating Active Directory and Exchange on-premises. Many businesses opt for AWS to implement the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best practices for secure cloud migration,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while Google Cloud provides medium enterprises with advanced data analysis and machine learning capabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider these factors in relation to your business goals to kickstart your cloud migration strategy successfully.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">The Cloud Migration Process</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a structured process is your best bet to help streamline the transition. Typically, businesses and their </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/technologies/cloud-computing-solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will follow a five-step approach to ensure a successful migration:</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Assessment and Planning</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by evaluating your existing applications and data. Recognize any dependencies, performance needs, and obstacles that may arise during migration. Develop a migration strategy that focuses on tasks according to their complexity and significance.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Proof of Concept</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">data migration to cloud best practices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, initiate a non-critical workload to establish a preliminary demonstration. This enables you to evaluate the transfer process, recognize any challenges, and fine-tune your strategy prior to expanding operations.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Phased Migration</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move applications and data in stages to reduce any disturbances. Start with less critical systems and gradually proceed to more crucial applications. This gradual method helps maintain business operations and allows for last-minute adjustments.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Use of Cloud-Native Services</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use cloud-based services and automation tools to simplify the migration process. These tools help automate tasks, maintain data accuracy, and minimize work. Employing services such as AWS Database Migration Service, Azure Migrate, or Google Cloud Migrate for Compute Engine can greatly facilitate the transition.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. Testing and Validation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the completion of each migration stage, it is crucial to test and validate the transferred applications and data. Confirm that all components operate as expected, performance meets benchmarks, and data integrity is maintained. Address any issues promptly before moving on to the next phase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Ensuring Security and Governance</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latency, performance, and cost are all things that demand attention in your strategy plan. But the most crucial facet of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">migration to cloud best practices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is strong data and cyber security, and data privacy and sovereignty compliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When migrating to the cloud, here are the key steps to follow:</span></p>
<h3><b>Implement and Emphasize Security Measures</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integrity of your cloud-based data is the bedrock of client and user trust. To ensure your cloud-based data remains just as safe as your on-prem data, implement (at a minimum) data at rest and transit encryption, multi-factor authentication, and routine security audits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your cloud provider likely has these tools built in, so ingrain them into your migration strategy.</span></p>
<h3><b>Establish a Clear Cloud Governance Model</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migrating to the cloud is an ideal time to review and implement current data and access governance. When reviewing and renewing ACLs, include policies for data management, access control, and resource usage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clear governance policy prevents unauthorized access and ensures the cloud environment is consistently managed. Tools such as </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS Organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (AD Group Policy in the cloud), and </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Cloud Resource Manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all have different rules-based syntax. Be sure to understand them when renewing governance policy.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Requirements</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compliance with local and international industry standards is critical. Identify regulations regarding data privacy, security, and sovereignty, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HIPAA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/healthcare-it-solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare industry</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voluntary frameworks such as </span><a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SOC 2</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s likely your cloud provider is aware of the regulations and enforces compliance. However, you should still conduct regular audits with the tools and frameworks provided by your cloud service.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Testing and Validation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cloud migration, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/qa-and-software-testing-services"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testing and validation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aren’t reserved for the finish line. Rather, they are ongoing processes and essential for a successful migration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how to approach testing and validation:</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Test, Retest, Test Again</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functional testing, performance testing, and security testing must be performed throughout the migration process to ensure everything works as expected. Targets will include applications (server and client), infrastructure, data ingress and egress, and user experience. </span></p>
<h3><b>2. Data Integrity and Security Validation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing of data migration and storage processes is important. Validate that data integrity has been maintained during and after the migration and that security measures are actively protecting data. Backup legacy data pre-migration in case everything goes sideways and recovery is required.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Retain Test, Dev, and Prod Environments</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like your on-prem environment, segment cloud infrastructure into test, development, and production. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Test</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Mirrors the production environment to simulate real-world updates, upgrades, and environment changes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Dev</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Developers can </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/cloud-computing-in-software-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experiment and innovate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without risking production stability and functionality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prod</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Your main operating environment. Once tests are passed, deployment to production can be performed with confidence, knowing it has been validated in the test environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This segmentation functions exactly like your existing testing environments but is much more easily implemented in the cloud. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Monitoring and Optimization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful data and applications migration is cause for celebration, but the work doesn’t stop there. Your new cloud-based system requires continuous monitoring and optimization of available resources to continue to function just as your on-prem infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how to ensure your cloud setup remains efficient and is ready to be scaled:</span></p>
<h3><b>Performance and Scalability</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User demand fluctuates, meaning you must be ready to meet demand peaks. Ensure your cloud environment is up to the task by using the cloud-native tools available from your provider to track resource utilization, application performance, and overall system health.</span></p>
<h3><b>Cost Efficiency</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overestimating resources is a common issue with newly migrated systems. Review your cloud spending regularly to identify and reduce inefficiencies. Optimize resource allocation and scaling policies to eliminate over-provisioning and claim back operational costs.</span></p>
<h3><b>Cloud-Native Services and Automation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your cloud provider has inbuilt tools that allow you to perform monitoring and optimization. Tools such as </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS Auto Scaling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure Automation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Cloud Autoscaler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatically adjust resources based on load and demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor the use of the tools into your migration planning to ensure optimal performance and cost management. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Post-Migration Activities</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the completion of the cloud migration (and subsequent celebrations), it’s time to focus on post-migration activities, with a focus on managing change and fostering resilience and pushback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the key steps to manage this phase effectively and ensure the ongoing success and stability: </span></p>
<h3><b>Stakeholder Consideration</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The needs and expectations of your users, customers, vendors, and partners require careful consideration. Change is harder for some people to cope with than others. Make sure you communicate clearly and frequently to ensure all stakeholders are informed and on board with the new cloud environment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Strong Maintenance Plan</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For teams managing a new environment, implement a </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/software-maintenance-support"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comprehensive maintenance plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep your cloud environment running as smoothly as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with on-prem, regular updates, patches, and performance tuning are still essential for maintaining your system&#8217;s efficiency and security.</span></p>
<h3><b>Automate Runbooks</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to efficient cloud operations is automation. Automate runbooks to empower your IT teams to respond fast to incidents without introducing the risks you faced with your on-prem environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This level of automation will ultimately reduce the need for overtime and allow your team to concentrate on bringing further innovation to your business.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-27767 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/blog2-1024x665.png" alt="it-outsourcing-strategy" width="1024" height="665" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/blog2-1024x665.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/blog2-300x195.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/blog2-768x499.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/blog2-1536x998.png 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/blog2-600x390.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/blog2-450x292.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/blog2-1000x650.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/blog2.png 1550w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2><b>What Are the Outsourcing Strategies</b><b>? </b></h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Outsourcing means finding and hiring a third-party service provider to deal with certain tasks that are beyond the capabilities of the in-house team. Recently, the practice of working with external service providers has grown into a trend as it brings a number of benefits to the outsourcers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;blockquote&quot;,{}]"><em>Outsourcing strategy is a plan built on the analyses and assessment of the functions that should be better performed by an external service. It means that the company defines tasks that are hard or impossible to perform with its own resources and starts searching for companies that have all the necessary tools and qualified staff to deal with the task within the stated time frame.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The same goes for outsourcing strategies, as IT companies work in different directions within the field and might not have all the means to complete certain operations or implement new technologies on their own.</p>

<h2><b>Types of Outsourcing: What Is the Difference?</b></h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Over the years, outsourcing strategies have developed and grown into different types that have specific purposes.</p>
<p>Outsourcing can be divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Onshore – you are looking for third-party services in your own country</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/nearshore-software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearshore</a> – hiring from the neighboring countries</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/offshore-software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Offshore</a> – working with distant countries</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, outsourcing strategies are usually grouped into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional Outsourcing: your company lacks mobile app developers, so you decide to outsource the professionals who can fill in the gap and provide their services.</li>
<li>IT Outsourcing: nowadays, small or large companies in any field have IT needs (infrastructure, software development, maintenance, support, etc.). It&#8217;s usually cheaper to contact a third-party IT service rather than build your own to deal with certain functions.</li>
<li>Multisourcing: this strategy means hiring IT services in combination with other business functions.</li>
<li>Manufacturer Outsourcing: if you want to produce products under your brand, you might look for a company (manufacturer) that already has all the necessary equipment and is capable of providing you services.</li>
<li>Process-Specific Outsourcing: means hiring an outsourcing team that specializes in a narrow or specific service.</li>
<li>Project Outsourcing: you have too many projects, and you cannot complete all of them, so you look for a company that will deal with one or a number.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>What IT Services Are Usually Outsourced? </b></h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 3 []">Before you start building your outsourcing strategies, it&#8217;s important to also understand what IT services can be outsourced. It will enable you to request the relevant set of services that will help you achieve desired results within a shorter time frame. The most widely outsourced services it&#8217;s possible to name:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web development</li>
<li>Application development</li>
<li>Custom software development</li>
<li>Mobile app development</li>
<li>Product development</li>
<li>Website or app testing</li>
<li>Application maintenance and support</li>
<li>Database management</li>

<h2><b>Steps to Develop an Effective </b><b>IT Outsourcing Strategy</b></h2>
<p>Here are some hands-on tips that will help you to build a winning business strategy for IT outsourcing needs.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">1. Define Your Outsourcing Goals</h3>
<p>The first and most important step in developing an outsourcing strategy is clearly setting up your goals and expectations. You should clearly define what type of software you need, what challenges it has to solve for your business, and how fast you want it to be done. Gather all the information and requirements into one document that you will use as a guide.</p>
<h3>2. Choose Reliable Outsourcing Partner</h3>
<p>The market is overflowing with outsourcing companies so your main task is to choose the best-matching partner for loyal and long-lasting collaboration. Do some research and trim down your list to a couple of options. After that, check out carefully their websites, and don&#8217;t forget to take a look at their clients&#8217; reviews on external sources. Also, you can contact them and describe your project to see which company offers you the best price and conditions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25548 size-full" style="font-size: 16px;" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/IT-outsourcing-strategies-developer.jpg" alt="IT outsourcing strategies developer" width="640" height="390" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/IT-outsourcing-strategies-developer.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/IT-outsourcing-strategies-developer-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/IT-outsourcing-strategies-developer-600x366.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/IT-outsourcing-strategies-developer-450x274.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">3. Pick Matching Engagement Model</h3>
<p>There are 3 main engagement models — the dedicated team model, the team extension model, and the project-based model. We highly recommend you <a href="https://intellectsoft.net/l/41/engagement-models-billing-plans" rel="noopener noreferrer">get familiar with all of them</a> in order to understand which one fits your business needs, and is the perfect choice for you. However, if you don&#8217;t know what decision to make, you can also contact your outsourcing partner and discuss all possible solutions for you and rely on their expertise and advice.</p>
<h3>4. Plan Your Budget</h3>
<p>Now, once you are halfway to success, it&#8217;s important to calculate the project budget and understand how many financial resources will be needed to finalize the idea. It&#8217;s crucial to also take into account also all the potential hidden costs and risks that can happen during your collaboration and plan your budget accordingly. Software development processes can often be very unpredictable so in order to stay antifragile in the process, it&#8217;s better to be ready for different financial outcomes.</p>
<h3>5. Actively Track Outsourcing Progress</h3>
<p>Once the development process is started your core task is to closely manage all the software development steps and track all progress. Taking into account that the outsourcing team is usually located in the vendor&#8217;s premises, you will have to learn to manage developers remotely and track their productivity and effectiveness with no opportunity to see them in person. Use management tools, set clear tasks and expectations, and always stay open to communication to make sure that your team and outsourcing colleagues are on the same page.</p>
<h3>6. Build Strong Communication with a Vendor</h3>
<p>As we mentioned above, managing a remote outsourcing team is not always easy. Therefore, it&#8217;s your responsibility to establish robust and timely communication with a vendor and a remote team to avoid potential risks and miscommunication. Set up a schedule of video conference calls, and organize chats for all team members. We also recommend you schedule face-to-face meetings with each team member individually to communicate project details clearly and make all the processes smooth.</p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Primary Advantages of Strategic Outsourcing</strong></h2>
<p>External cooperation brings a number of advantages of outsourcing strategy as the company can build a wide network of competencies linked by outsourcing contracts, from which necessary functions such as raw materials, components, and systems can be outsourced.</p>
<p>The company can build strong relationships and partner with external services to work on certain small projects or tasks on a regular basis. It gives a chance to exchange knowledge and experience between the companies, build tight, professional relationships, and develop the managerial and communication skills of both teams.</p>
<p>In addition to this, strategies of outsourcing can offer such advantages as:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26173 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/1--1024x696.png" alt="statistics" width="1024" height="696" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/1--1024x696.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/1--300x204.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/1--768x522.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/1--1536x1044.png 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/1--2048x1392.png 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/1--600x408.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/1--450x306.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/wp-content/uploads/1--1000x680.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Reduced Expenses</strong></h3>
<p>It is one of the most prominent advantages of outsourcing. It is common practice to be based in the USA or Western Europe but hire teams or individual specialists from Asian countries, India happens to be the most popular one. There are companies that offer their services at a lower price in comparison with fixed cost of the US and EU companies, but they have proven to be of high quality.</p>
<h3><strong>Better Efficiency </strong></h3>
<p>Outsourcing results in higher efficiency, as you hire experienced teams who can deal with complex tasks and can provide the most effective and suitable solutions for your company. As they have a good understanding of the field and years of experience, productivity, and efficiency increase.</p>
<h3><strong>Focus on Important Tasks </strong></h3>
<p>Outsourcing services will take care of the issue you are facing at all stages of the process. The CEO and managers of the company would be kept in the loop but they will not be required to perform any of the tasks related to the project. Thus, it gives them an opportunity to work on the other important aspects of your company&#8217;s development.</p>
<h3><strong>No Need to Invest in New Tech Tools </strong></h3>
<p>Outsourcing service takes all the responsibility for the infrastructure and technologies. In most cases, they already have all the necessary tools to work on your task.</p>
<h3><strong>Skilled and Experienced Resources </strong></h3>
<p>Outsourcing saves your time spent on recruitment and training of the specialists for the in-house team. Companies that provide outsourcing services have highly-qualified, experienced, and educated experts who will be able to complete the project.</p>
<p>It follows that outsourcing is also time-effective, as you do not have to spend years searching for the candidates and growing the specialists you need to support your business growth and development.</p>
<h2><strong>Main Disadvantages of Strategic Outsourcing</strong></h2>
<p>Though advantages of strategic outsourcing are prevailing, it still has a few disadvantages that you need to keep in mind as well. Among the top challenges that companies encounter while outsourcing are data security risk concerns, disaster recovery issues, as well as potential problems with data ownership.</p>
<p>In addition, it&#8217;s not that easy to maintain communication while outsourcing as usually, you are going to be located in various time zones, different countries and even on different continents with the big time-zone difference. In its turn, it can create slower response time, potential misunderstandings, as well as a language barrier.</p>
<p>In case you collaborate with a reliable outsourcing partner you will manage to easily avoid these issues. Finding the cheapest vendor is not an option if you want to receive quality services.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it&#8217;s paramount to check the outsourcing service before you have a contract with them. It should be a company with a good portfolio and customers&#8217; reviews. It is recommended to contact previous customers in order to have a better picture of the company and make sure they have a good reputation and provide excellent services.</p>

<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Strategies for IT Outsourcing: Things to Know</strong></h2>
<p>IT outsourcing strategies require the cooperation of several departments (legal, HR, operations, etc.), and the outcome depends on unified work and a clear business plan. Usually, organizations have only one goal for this strategy: to get the best technologies at the lowest cost. But it can lead to failure, and it is essential to take into account the tips listed above.</p>
<p>First of all, it is essential to have clear objectives, and your team should understand them. Another critical issue in external outsourcing is communication. Companies should make it simple and clear for both parties to understand the requirements, terms, and conditions of the cooperation.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Practices for Implementing Successful IT Outsourcing Strategies</strong></h2>
<p>It cannot be said that there are bad or good outsourcing strategies. The success of outsourcing depends on a number of aspects that every company should think of before hiring external services. Although IT outsourcing strategies described above have different goals, they all have the same structure. Thus, there are certain steps to follow in order to make it successful.</p>
<ol>
<li>Outsource the right things for the right reasons: do not only fall for a cost-driven strategy but make sure that both outsourcing and your business strategies are aligned.</li>
<li>Define what you expect: develop a sound business case that outlines the business value of outsourcing and how this initiative supports your company&#8217;s objectives. In addition, develop an achievable and realistic plan for the end product you and your outsourcing partner can rely on.</li>
<li>Prepare the documentation: in order to make the collaboration between you and an outsourcing partner effective, you need to prepare all the relevant specifications and requirements to proceed with the development right away. At the end of the article, we have prepared a quick checklist that will help you make sure you have all the necessary documents ready.</li>
<li>Choose the right vendor: the vendor should suit your needs and be capable of completing tasks of any complexity. Take your time and research the company&#8217;s reviews on the Internet as well to see what their previous clients say about them. Also, do not underestimate your in-house staff and make sure that senior management is involved in the process.</li>
<li>Pick the best-matching <a href="https://intellectsoft.net/l/41/engagement-models-billing-plans" rel="noopener noreferrer">outsourcing engagement model</a>. There are three main different approaches to collaborating with an IT outsourcing company so research each option. Before you make your final decision, it&#8217;s crucial to know what financial resources you are ready to allocate for the development process. Once you know your budget, you will be able to choose the right engagement model that will help you get all the work done that will fit into the budget that is most suitable for your team.</li>
<li>Create an effective contract: it should reflect strategic goals and clearly define expectations for the vendor and the company. It&#8217;s the legal basis of your partnership so pay close attention to this aspect.</li>
<li>Track the process: make sure that you are getting what you have paid for. Reporting on the project&#8217;s progress and transparency are extremely important. It would be highly recommended to clearly define your KPIs so you can easily track your progress and make sure everything is done in a timely manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the aspects that companies should keep in mind in order to outsource external services successfully.</p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Bonus: Checklist for Outsourcing Efficiency</strong></h2>
<p>Before you even consider outsourcing your software development services, it&#8217;s important to go through the preparation stage. Make sure you can answer the questions below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you and your team clear about the main task or project that you are planning to outsource?</li>
<li>Do you have all the documentation ready such as an outline or manual describing in detail your future project? Make sure it contains the following information:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Specific task/project description</li>
<li>Main technical requirements</li>
<li>Description of a customer problem that you want to solve as well as the possible solution</li>
<li>Expected results</li>

<li>Deadlines</li>
<li>Technical skills that you are looking for</li>

<h3>3. Increased Investment in Progressive Web Apps</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like blockchain technology, progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are also not new — they’ve been around since their introduction in 2015. However, it is now gaining widespread adoption and acceptance, with a CAGR of 31.9% and a </span><a href="https://www.emergenresearch.com/industry-report/progressive-web-application-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market value of up to $10.44 billion by 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also seems that the tech industry has caught up to PWA technology, especially given the exponential increase in mobile usage over the past decade. PWAs offer an opportunity for website owners to improve their website’s user experience and aesthetics by giving them a more app-like feel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development scene is seeing more site owners investing in PWAs. Previously, converting to PWAs wasn’t so common, which is why </span><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/a-one-year-pwa-retrospective-f4a2f4129e05"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made headlines for converting. Following an analysis of areas that caused poor site performance and retention, Pinterest went through an overhaul by rebuilding the website using React and converting it into a PWA. As a result, the site enjoyed a 40% increase in time spent on the platform and 44% more revenue. This was back in 2017.</span></p>
<h3>4. More Companies are Embracing Low-Code/No-Code Development</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no secret that developing software can be a lengthy and tedious process. Low-code and no-code development offer developers a much faster and easier way to create apps with minimum coding, allowing teams to ship in record time.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-12-13-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-low-code-development-technologies-market-to-grow-20-percent-in-2023"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gartner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has previously projected that companies of all sizes will begin to embrace low-code development, with the adoption rate set to exceed 50% through 2026. Experts suggest that the key drivers that will accelerate the adoption of low-code and no-code development are:</span></p>
<ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, these development types allow teams to develop apps with a limited budget and much shorter timeframes. Low code platforms function similarly to purpose-built Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) or platforms that are specifically designed to address varying needs and challenges. Some popular low-code platforms include Mendix, Appian, and Visual LANSA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some examples of low-code use cases are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leveraging an existing SaaS infrastructure with customized features according to what a specific business needs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transitioning to a cloud-based relational database from traditional spreadsheets</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Converting legacy applications into modern versions</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>5. The Emergence of FinOps and GreenOps</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cloud computing landscape is currently ushering in the emergence of the FinOps and GreenOps movements, counting them among the latest software development trends. Given the fairly recent upheavals with regard to the way things work, more companies are recognizing how important it is to streamline operations and processes across the board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, FinOps seeks to drive efficiency across various financial processes, whereas GreenOps focuses on implementing eco-friendly practices in line with long-term value creation. By integrating FinOps and GreenOps, businesses can work to increase their bottom line, comply with regulations, support sustainability efforts, and improve their brand reputation.</span></p>
<h3>6. Serverless Computing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serverless computing, also called Function as a Service (FaaS), allows developers to create applications and services without having to manage infrastructure, leading to better efficiency and cost savings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the leading providers are Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Functions. For example, streaming provider Netflix has started using AWS Lambda for certain functions within the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lambda takes care of tasks such as user authentication,  encoding videos, and backend processes. This allows Netflix to scale its resources based on demand without needing to manage servers while providing a smooth user experience and cutting costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify, on the other hand, uses </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/spotify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Cloud Functions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to handle tasks such as user authentication, processing user-generated content, and backend tasks for music recommendation algorithms.</span></p>
<h3>7. Greater Reliance on Distributed Computing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed computing is another software development trend that is gaining more popularity in 2024. Distributed computing is a way of data sharing by way of different computer servers connected as a group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, large volumes of data that may be too much work for just one server can be spread across multiple servers and thus be processed much more quickly. Distributed computing allows applications to scale accordingly by just adding servers as needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, distributed computing improves performance while minimizing costs. Best of all, a system failure in one server will not affect others — allowing for continuity of operations should something arise.</span></p>
<h3>8. Increased Focus on Cybersecurity with DevSecOps</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Development + Security + Operations is DevSecOps. In a nutshell, it’s an automation, platform design, and culture approach. It also integrates security as a crucial and shared responsibility throughout the IT lifecycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many more companies are beefing up their cybersecurity programs with DevSecOps, as it focuses on built-in security over security measures built around data and apps. DevSecOps prioritizes early detection of potential risks and fixing these vulnerabilities before they become more significant issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevSecOps breaks down silos between different teams and puts security at the forefront of all commit and pull requests. Compliance is also of utmost importance in the DevSecOps pipeline, and as such, compliance and security checks are always integrated.</span></p>
<h3>9. Ushering the AR/VR Era</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR and VR are no longer confined to just video games and entertainment. For clarity, whereas AR uses real-life elements supplemented with computer-generated content to create an interactive and dynamic user experience, VR is entirely a virtual, immersive simulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more businesses are seeing the value of these technologies in 2024 and are using them to create real-world simulations for customers and stakeholders, as well as interactive training programs for employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, large pieces of tech or machinery that cannot realistically be brought into a trade show fair can be rendered via VR or AR, allowing customers and stakeholders to “experience” what it’s like. The same applies to prototypes that may not yet be ready but already have a defined blueprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, training programs can be enriched with demonstrative and hands-on training through VR and AR, allowing staff to perfect muscle memory without even having to operate the real thing right away (like heavy machinery and other equipment).</span></p>
<h3>10. Microservice Architecture</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microservices architecture in software development refers to a different approach to software development. Microservices focus on creating single-function modules with specifically defined interfaces and operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is in line with Agile and DevOps and has really picked up in recent years. Microservice architecture is small in scale and independent, allowing smaller development teams to write and maintain services much quicker and more efficiently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such an architecture, each layer of service is separated from the codebase, making it easy to manage. This allows developers to update and manage an app or service without needing to rebuild or redeploy the whole thing.</span></p>
<h3>11. AI in Healthcare</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI offers to the medical sector what a </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/artificial-intelligence-in-health-care.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed to be among the top three goals of AI in healthcare: Improved efficiency, lower costs, and enhanced products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the practical ways AI can help support these goals is by developing AI software that can improve symptom analysis through patient data, automatically detect medication errors, and automate administrative tasks overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture capitalists have also reportedly invested over </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/transforming-healthcare-with-ai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$8.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the top 50 healthcare AI firms, highlighting the current importance of AI in healthcare.</span></p>
<h3>12. NFT Tokens in Cryptocurrency</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are digital elements connected to the Blockchain. They are called such because they are non-fungible, meaning that they’re completely unique and not interchangeable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No two NFTs are similar, and this concept has pushed it to become a significant trend, especially concerning Blockchain-based payments in recent times. It is already one of the most common payment methods in software development outsourcing, possibly because it allows for fast, secure, reliable, and transparent payment between people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFTs are </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-non-fungible-token-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow exponentially and reach $211.7 billion by 2030, with a growth rate of 34.2%. NFTs are built on smart contracts or self-executing lines of code, allowing for speedy and secure transactions.</span></p>
<h3>13. React Native Continues to Thrive</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programming React Native has emerged at the top of the hybrid development market. This is because it allows developers to create high-quality cross-platform applications using a single codebase.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three basic IT architecture tiers of Web 3.0 are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Interaction: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This refers to the content, hardware, and software that users communicate with</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Computation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes up the logic to enable the interaction between users and the above elements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Information: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refers to the data and structure required for computing functions to be done accurately and efficiently.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web 3.0 apps are characterized by complexity and interactivity and go a step beyond the static pages we got used to in previous web versions. JavaScript development is used to create Web 3.0 apps, making them both dynamic and responsive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Web 3.0 applications are already available on desktop browsers and some high-end mobile devices like smartphones with OLED panels. However, tech experts anticipated a much higher volume of Web 3.0 apps and compatible devices moving forward.</span></p>
<h3>18. Cloud-Native Technologies Continue to Evolve</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud-native technologies and cloud-based architectures allow one to design, construct, and operate cloud-developed workloads, taking full advantage of the cloud computing model. Cloud-native prioritizes agility and better speed, allowing organizations to create strategic solutions that can support their business growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, cloud-native technologies will continue to evolve and increase in usage as cloud-native implementation allows developers to develop and execute scalable applications. Cloud-native apps work across modern and dynamic work environments, such as private, public, and hybrid clouds. This also covers microservices, containers,  immutable infrastructure, service meshes, and declarative APIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, with cloud-native stacks like DevOps and GitOps, developers can easily use continuous innovation and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to test applications while simultaneously pushing new code into production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By leveraging cloud-native development, organizations can bank on built-in scalability and match any demand profile without investing in added infrastructure design or provisioning. Cloud-native development also allows developers to choose from various tools instead of being limited to in-the-box options.</span></p>
<h3>19. The Advent of IoB (Internet of Behavior)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization is an important driver of success in any business. The more effective your service is, the more your users will adapt their approach to your infrastructure. The Internet of Behavior (IoB) brings to the table important data like user behaviors, interests, and preferences from Big Data,  BI (Business Intelligence), and CDPs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulling from wearable devices, smart household electrical gadgets, and individual internet activity, IoB reveals valuable information on user behavior and their interests. IoB facilitates easier tracking, merging, and evaluating large volumes of data from various online activities and personal behaviors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes things like social media habits and even commercial transactions. IoB is a little behind IoT in terms of momentum and adaptation. However, as consumers continue to gravitate toward personalization and businesses seek ways to give users a customized (yet still on-brand experience), it is highly likely that IoB will gain greater momentum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoB is already being used by companies and startups. YouTube, for example, has begun to provide viewers with a more customized feed, much like Facebook and other social media platforms. Overall, IoB can help businesses resolve challenges that may hinder them from closing sales and acts much like consumer surveys without needing to expressly ask consumers about their preferences.</span></p>
<h3>20. Edge Computing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edge computing is called such because it processes data closer to the “edge” of the network or where it’s created—in an effort to greatly reduce latency and bandwidth use. According to </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/edge-computing-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the global edge computing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 37.4% by 2027.  </span><a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/edge-computing-market-103760"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune Business Insights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projects that the global edge computing market will grow from $15.96 billion in 2023 to $139.58 billion by 2030. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edge computing is particularly crucial for IoT devices because they generate huge amounts of data. It can also improve privacy and security as data is kept locally. This is in opposition to centralized cloud platforms, which are not the closest to data sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increasing number of businesses have started to shift their analytics and decision-making from centralized cloud platforms to the edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trend is largely driven by the observation that data captured at the edge often requires processing, storage, and analysis on-site, and it can’t always be done via cloud-based applications due to cost implications, uptime constraints, and latency issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edge computing is an evolution of on-premise computing. It is technically an IT architecture that processes client data at the network’s edge, closest to the site of capture. By bringing computing closer to such data sources, edge computing is able to reduce latency and enhance real-time data processing capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edge computing is particularly useful for applications that require immediate data analysis, such as autonomous vehicles and smart city technologies. In the field of healthcare, edge computing also ensures utmost data privacy and allows for AI-based real-time monitoring and close analysis of the patient’s condition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When applied in practice, this technology can transform traffic management by regulating traffic lanes, optimizing bus schedules, and even guiding autonomous vehicle flows.</span></p>
<h3>21. Quantum Computing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The principles of superposition and entanglement are among the most fundamental quantum-mechanical phenomena used in quantum computing for data operations. Quantum computing is an even more advanced form of computing that uses quantum bits (called qubits) instead of classical bits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The capacity to execute specific calculations much faster than classical computers is one of the primary advantages of quantum computing.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The new program </b><a href="https://www.ukukrainetechbridge.org/"><b>TechBridge</b></a><b>, launched by the governments of Ukraine and the UK, marks the beginning of the next-generation digital infrastructure distributed across Europe and beyond. We spoke to Yevhen Kulinichenko, Chief Engineering Officer of Slagato technology's the technology partner of Fortune companies including EY, Nestle, and Jaguar. Yevhen talked about their latest trials aimed at enhancing software development processes by incorporating generative AI assistance.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT has gained a reputation as a transformative tool that reshapes certain aspects of our development processes. IT professionals are using it to automate and streamline specific tasks, such as assisting in writing test cases or providing quick solutions to common coding problems. On the business side, ChatGPT assists in rapid prototyping and ideation phases, where its ability to generate coherent, context-aware text can significantly speed up the initial stages of development. However, its effectiveness is constrained by the scope of its training and its lack of deep, project-specific context. It can suggest but not validate, nor can it understand the nuanced requirements of complex, custom software solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slagato technology’s </span><b>Center of Excellence (CoE)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an innovation hub where our technical teams conduct experiments and test new approaches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview covers our expert’s perspective on the use of AI, specifically focusing on GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models and their applications, limitations, and impacts on software development. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dive right in! What are your plans for contributing to the TechBridge project?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b>My plans for contributing to the TechBridge project are strategically focused on leveraging our technological expertise to maximize the project&#8217;s success while ensuring alignment with our broader business objectives. Firstly, we intend to deploy a cross-functional team of our best engineers and developers, who will work closely with the TechBridge project stakeholders. This team will not only bring in-depth technical knowledge but also a profound understanding of agile methodologies to ensure rapid and efficient project development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key aspect of our contribution will be the integration of advanced technologies like AI and cloud computing to enhance the project&#8217;s capabilities. For instance, we plan to utilize AI algorithms to analyze and optimize data flow, ensuring efficient processing and storage of data. Cloud computing resources will be leveraged for scalable infrastructure, ensuring the project can adapt to changing demands seamlessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, we recognize the importance of sustainability in technology. Therefore, our involvement will also focus on developing sustainable and environmentally friendly technology solutions. We&#8217;ll explore and implement green computing practices to minimize the environmental impact of our technological contributions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, we plan to contribute a blend of technical excellence, innovative thinking, collaborative engagement, <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/fraud-detection-with-machine-learning-and-ai/">security-conscious practices</a>, and a commitment to sustainability to the TechBridge program. We aim to help set a foundation for its long-term success and growth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">You mentioned AI implementation as a focus area. Can you expand on that?</span></h2>
<p><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to build on the experience that we already have. In 2023, we conducted experiments on improving software development processes by implementing generative AI assistance. Results are still being finalized, but we&#8217;ve identified dozens of scenarios where ChatGPT can be safely utilized to streamline delivery and facilitate problem-solving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we delve deeper into the utilization of ChatGPT in software development, we&#8217;re uncovering its profound potential in augmenting our coding processes. For instance, when dealing with boilerplate code, ChatGPT can swiftly generate templates for commonly used code structures in various programming languages like Python or JavaScript, significantly reducing repetitive tasks. We&#8217;ve experimented with using it to draft initial versions of RESTful API endpoints, where it considers standard practices and even suggests appropriate HTTP methods and response codes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve also started leveraging ChatGPT for debugging assistance. By describing a bug in natural language, the model can suggest potential causes and solutions, drawing from a wide range of similar issues it has learned from. This doesn&#8217;t replace a developer&#8217;s expertise but acts as an additional tool to accelerate problem-solving. Thus, while ChatGPT is a game-changer in certain aspects of software development, it works best as a complement to human skills, enhancing productivity and quickly highlighting some basic blind spots or standard reusable patterns. However, it still cannot handle the complex logic, style, or requirements.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can ChatGPT handle tasks requiring senior-level expertise?</span></h2>
<p><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT is limited in <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/web-application-architecture/">creating novel solutions</a>. It works by learning from vast amounts of text data to generate plausible word combinations. However, it neither invents nor actually comprehends ideas. It is still a mathematical algorithm that arranges words according to numeric probabilities. There is no independent consciousness that is inherent to human intelligence. ChatGPT’s utility is rather in quick recommendations based on existing knowledge.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does ChatGPT compare with development environment tools like PyCharm?</span></h2>
<p><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s an interesting question. Indeed, Integrated Development Environments (IDE) like PyCharm offer tools like code completion, debugging, and context-aware refactoring options that consider the entire project structure. What’s more, It can adapt to the style and requirements of the codebase it’s working with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, ChatGPT&#8217;s understanding of software languages and programming concepts is broad but can be superficial. It lacks the ability to understand the deeper context of a software project, such as project-specific architectures, dependencies, or the state of the current codebase. It can assist in generating code snippets, providing documentation references, or even suggesting solutions to coding problems. Still, it’s limited to the data that it’s trained on and doesn’t attend to the entire code structure and its state in real time like IDEs.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there any concerns about the misuse of ChatGPT?</span></h2>
<p><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, there&#8217;s a risk of misuse, especially if ChatGPT provides information based on public data that could be harmful. The potential for misuse of technologies like ChatGPT forms a crucial part of our risk assessment and management strategy. There&#8217;s always a possibility of inappropriate information being fed into AI models with malicious intent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in the software development realm, we can talk about the potential for intellectual property theft or inadvertent leakage. ChatGPT, when fed with sensitive data, could incorporate this information into its outputs, leading to data breaches. As a result, proprietary code or business logic could be exposed. So, for now, my recommendation is to refrain from trying to fix the code in ChatGPT or copy-pasting any information that might be considered sensitive. And since chatGPT 4 can now crawl the web, make sure your websites and social media accounts are properly protected as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, there&#8217;s the risk of psychological dependency on AI. Over-reliance of IT professionals on ChatGPT for code generation or problem-solving could lead to a degradation of fundamental skills. I think it&#8217;s vital to use such tools to augment, not replace, human expertise, ensuring that core development skills are retained and nurtured within the team.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, what&#8217;s your perspective on the future of ChatGPT and AI in collaborative programs like TechBridge?</span></h2>
<p><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to the future, I anticipate significant advancements in tools like ChatGPT, particularly in their integration with more and more traditional software development tools and environments. We&#8217;re likely to see more sophisticated versions that offer better contextual understanding and can interact dynamically with existing codebases, potentially offering more nuanced and targeted suggestions, which will help us quickly scale and efficiently maintain <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/enterprise-software-development">global digital infrastructures</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These advancements could lead to models that not only assist in code generation but also play a role in code review processes, offering Slagato insights based on coding best practices and even specific project history. Furthermore, as AI models become more adept at understanding and generating human languages, they will become invaluable in bridging communication gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders, facilitating a clearer understanding of project goals and requirements. This evolution will require a shift in how we perceive these tools, not just as assistants but as integral components of our software development ecosystems, enhancing both efficiency and creativity.</span></p>
