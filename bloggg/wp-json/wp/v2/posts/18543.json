Though the term is mainly relevant to business, it also falls under government, mass media, culture, medicine, science, and many other industries. Simply put, it\u2019s a big strategic change that affects company operations and how to elevate the customer experience. Digital transformation is also a synonym for \u201cpaperless,\u201d meaning that all the data is digitalized and stored in the company\u2019s system.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21150 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"What Is Digital Transformation\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-450x300.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/What-Is-Digital-Transformation-min-1000x667.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Implementing these solutions in your business will affect every department, and all the operations carried out within the company. It will change the way your company functions internally and externally. Thus, successfully undergoing digital transformation will bring value to the overall business workflow and customer experience by rethinking existing business processes to meet evolving market and customer demands now.<\/p>\n<h2><span data-color=\"transparent\">Examples of Digital Transformation: You&#8217;ve Already Seen Them<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Digital transformation is evident everywhere. While some companies adapt more slowly, the shift is inevitable. It\u2019s a smart move and one of the more significant strategies for staying competitive. Various industries have successfully implemented digital technologies to enhance customer experiences and streamline operations, showcasing numerous digital transformation examples.<\/p>\n<p>Have you seen Nike\u2019s latest technology?

They\u2019re also optimizing their supply chain with IoT devices and predictive analytics.<\/p>\n<p>You can find examples of digital transformation everywhere nowadays, impacting nearly every aspect of human activity.<\/p>\n<h2><span data-color=\"transparent\">What&#8217;s the Difference Between Digital Transformation and Business Transformation?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Speaking of business and digital transformations, the first term, &#8220;business transformation,&#8221; is broader. It encompasses various transformations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">All companies must undergo a business transformation at some point to stay current with rapidly evolving trends, improve services, streamline workflows, and enhance customer communication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">&#8220;Business transformation&#8221; mainly means changes at all stages in every department. These &#8220;transformations&#8221; consist of:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Digital transformation:<\/span><\/strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">\u00a0Aimed at improving customer interactions and internal organization.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">IT functional transformation:<\/span><\/strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">\u00a0Focused on optimizing the work within the IT department.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Enterprise transformation:<\/span><\/strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">\u00a0Concentrated on how work is done throughout the entire company.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">In other words, business transformation calls for adopting new business models that align with modern market demands. Digital transformation, on the other hand, is about implementing the tools and solutions necessary to make these new strategies effective. It improves business-to-customer interactions, business-to-business cooperation, and internal company operations (business-to-employee).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">For example, in the healthcare sector, digital transformation focuses on technological tools and solutions to address operational challenges, ultimately achieving the broader goals of business transformation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-color=\"transparent\">The Digital Transformation Strategy Roadmap<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Entering a digital transformation journey involves several key stages that require careful planning and execution. You can start building a roadmap when you set a digital transformation framework. Remember that three main stages should be outlined and divided into smaller steps in the roadmap to make it easier:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1<\/strong>: Defining value. This stage involves securing senior management. It\u2019s the first step. Ensure that everyone in the company is engaged and actively participates. Gather board meetings with management and different departments of the company to define the goals of the transformation. Make them challenging and motivating. The last in this stage is the budget. Allocate funds for the resources and technologies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2<\/strong>: Launching and maintaining. It requires a strategic approach. Start by identifying lighthouse projects to start the digital transformation projects. Once these projects are tested and optimized, you can proceed with related projects to continue the transformation. Assemble a team of high-profile professionals with the necessary skills. Consider implementing new agile methods for work organization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3<\/strong>: Scaling up. From now on, continuously upgrade your technologies as they develop and offer new features and capabilities. In addition to technology, it\u2019s important that your employees undergo training; it helps them acquire new skills faster and much more effectively. Adopting the new operating model is the last thing to include in the roadmap.<\/p>\n<h2 data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><span data-color=\"transparent\">What Digital Technologies Can I Use?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21151 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Technologies-min-1024x685.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Transformation Technologies\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Technologies-min-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Technologies-min-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Technologies-min-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Technologies-min-1536x1027.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Technologies-min-2048x1370.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Technologies-min-600x401.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Technologies-min-450x301.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Technologies-min-1000x669.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/intellectsoft.net\/services\/digital-transformation-services\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital transformation is necessary for businesses in different industries<\/a> because of all the emerging digital technologies. These technologies change the way companies function and organize their work. They help deliver a better user experience and generate more revenue for the business. Staying informed about the digital transformation technologies and trends like AI and robotic process automation can significantly improve digital transformation strategies and help meet the needs of both employees and customers.<\/p>\n<p>We oversee certain tendencies in the technology used for the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/intellectsoft.net\/blog\/why-enterprises-need-digital-transformation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">digital transformation of the enterprise<\/a>; this list includes:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Cloud Computing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Many companies consider cloud computing the first to-go technology when entering a company\u2019s path of digital transformation. There are many good reasons for this. Overall, it improves internal and external processes, operations, and services. With its infrastructure, platforms, and computing abilities, cloud computing helps you stay agile in your business field. Considering this, cloud computing is cost- and labor-effective, and what is important to mention is that it is secure (you can omit system shutdowns and create several backups). Two more important things come with cloud computing: scale and speed. These two are necessary to win the competition in the market.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)\/Machine Learning (ML)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When properly used, AI and ML can help businesses earn additional income and reduce time spent executing day-to-day activities. With ML, you can analyze big and complex data and make accurate decisions based on available information. Minimize risks in production and create personalized experiences for your clients using AI. Thanks to these technologies, there is less room for errors and more for impeccable, high-quality service.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Blockchain<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Blockchain is a powerful asset for companies heading toward digital transformation. This technology facilitates transactions, eliminating third parties and making it easier and more transparent for partner businesses and clients. It would be mistaken to think that only finance and banking companies can use this technology. Now, you can find blockchain integration in diverse industries such as retail, supply chain, healthcare, and telecommunications. And this list doesn\u2019t end. We expect to see more usage of this technology in the coming future.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Augmented Reality is a real game-changer. It changes the departments\u2019 operational activities and enhances the company\u2019s competitiveness in the market. AR opens opportunities that once were hard to imagine, such as looking inside objects (machines, bodies) without opening them, examining and detecting them, and giving a full report with a description of the problem found inside. AR is applicable for product development, maintenance, and safety measures.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Internet of Things (IoT)<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Over the last few years, we&#8217;ve seen another giant trend: IoT. This technology brings many benefits to the business. For instance, you can use the data collected with the help of IoT to understand your customers and their needs better and, as a result, offer them better services. Also, IoT can help you polish your segmentation strategy and expand your target audience. It can also improve employee productivity and reduce costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-color=\"transparent\">Robotic Process Automation (RPA)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Imagine having a digital assistant who takes care of all those repetitive and mundane tasks that consume your time, like data entry or invoice processing. That&#8217;s exactly what Robotic Process Automation (RPA) does! By automating these routine activities, RPA boosts operational efficiency and accuracy and frees up your human resources to focus on more strategic, value-added activities. It&#8217;s like having an extra set of hands that never gets tired, making your business runsmoother and smarter.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-color=\"transparent\">Mobile Technology<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Those days when mobile phones were just for calls and texts are long gone! Today, mobile technology is everywhere, and it has changed the way we live and do business. From mobile tickets and wallets to entirely new business models like Uber, our dependence on mobile devices has greatly driven digital transformation.<\/span> Mobile technologies and<span data-color=\"transparent\"> apps make everything possible, from ordering dinner from a favorite restaurant to managing banking and investments. Now, it&#8217;s all about convenience and staying connected all the time anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-color=\"transparent\">Digitization<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Digitization is the process of converting paper-based information into digital formats. It revolutionizes industries like healthcare with electronic medical records (EMR) and government services by making public records accessible online. Digitization is the backbone of transformation<\/span> and digital initiatives everywhere<span data-color=\"transparent\">. It makes information more accessible, manageable, and secure, paving the way for a more efficient and connected world.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-color=\"transparent\">Digital Twins<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">With digital twins, you can now experiment with a replica of your physical products or environments to find the best ways to improve efficiency or effectiveness. For instance, a manufacturer can create a digital twin of their shop floor to imagine where to place machinery for better output or safety. Similarly, product manufacturers can design digital replicas to improve ergonomics or usability. This game-changing technology allows organizations to improve their processes without disrupting existing operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"widt5\">Digital Transformation Process: How Is It Done?<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-21152 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Process-min-1024x557.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Transformation Process\" width=\"1024\" height=\"557\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Process-min-1024x557.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Process-min-300x163.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Process-min-768x417.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Process-min-1536x835.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Process-min-2048x1113.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Process-min-600x326.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Process-min-450x245.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital-Transformation-Process-min-1000x543.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With all the ambition, digital transformation is impossible to complete in one day. Instead, it\u2019s a continuous process that involves a ton of work and effort. Significant investments in digital transformation efforts are necessary to improve operations and customer interactions. It requires careful planning and execution to ensure successful business outcomes. Like all processes, digital transformation involves several stages. We encourage you to get back to your company\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/intellectsoft.net\/blog\/what-is-digital-transformation-strategy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strategy<\/a>. Consider what you want to achieve, your objectives, where to play, and which technology to use and, importantly, not use.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a plan is just one part of the process, but going digital without one is a lost cause.<\/p>\n<p>Use these steps as a guide to the digital transformation process:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1.<\/strong>\u00a0Analyze the environment within and outside the company. It is important to understand where you stand and your strengths and weaknesses. Check how your competitors are dealing with similar problems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2.<\/strong>\u00a0Set transformation objectives. What do you want to see as the final result? What is the company\u2019s goal? Which operations, departments, or processes do you think are worth renovating? Answer these questions before proceeding to the next stages of the process. Involve your employees in the process. They can provide valuable insights and point out potential issues from their daily activities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3.<\/strong>\u00a0Choose the right technology and outline the budget. When considering the technology, don\u2019t underestimate thorough research. The future technology should suit the needs of your company, employees, and clients. Communicate with the vendor and set close relationships for further collaboration, as support of the system is as important as its development or implementation. Make sure the technology is scalable to continue growing even if some elements need maintenance or re-engineering.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 4.<\/strong>\u00a0Create a clear roadmap for the process and prioritize the activities. Access the company\u2019s capabilities, resources, and budget, identify changes, and do a cost-benefit analysis. Then, logically prioritize activities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 5.<\/strong>\u00a0Identify and train your team. Choose employees and create teams that can implement new technology. Show all the changes that you plan to make to the employees. It is important to educate your staff so they will be well-prepared once the new system is ready.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 6.<\/strong>\u00a0Implement the changes. This step includes running tests, ongoing maintenance, and adding necessary changes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 7.<\/strong>\u00a0Continuously undergo support for the new technologies. Use new features to stay up to date and increase the system and services\u2019 performance.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Benefits of Digital Transformation:<\/span><\/strong><span data-color=\"transparent\"> How Is It Useful for Your Business?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Considering the information above, we can highlight several benefits of digital transformation. Although the process can be time-consuming and require many resources, the advantages it offers cover the expenses and greatly increase\u00a0business value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">So, what are the benefits we get with the digital transformation of business?<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-color=\"transparent\">There will be less manual work as operations and processes are automized, making the overall work more efficient and almost flawless;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-color=\"transparent\">Reduced time spent on day-to-day activities;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-color=\"transparent\">The client&#8217;s satisfaction will grow.

Measuring ROI is an important step in defining the effectiveness of your digital transformation initiatives. Make sure your company is well-equipped for the dynamic tech environment. From then on, your<\/span> digital business always<span data-color=\"transparent\"> adapts, upgrades, and constantly responds to innovative tech trends. Assessing ROI is important to see if your business is moving along the right path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">At the start, each company\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/forbes.com\/sites\/forbestechcouncil\/2020\/01\/14\/the-roi-of-digital-transformation#522607545a22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-color=\"transparent\">may measure ROI<\/span><\/a><span data-color=\"transparent\"> in its own way, as objectives and metrics can differ. However, there are some common steps to ease the way and see if your digital metamorphosis is compelling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Step 1. Establish Your Goals<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">There are many reasons why it&#8217;s essential to define your objectives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">First is because it will directly impact the metrics of your ROI. Consider your company&#8217;s specific challenges, requirements, and cultural values. Some businesses may need to increase operational agility, while others may chase it to boost customer experience. At this step, ensure that<\/span> business leaders and<span data-color=\"transparent\"> all the senior management are headed in the same direction and share similar values. At this stage, ensure that all senior management is aligned and shares similar values. This alignment will prevent chaos and confusion from a lack of clear goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Step 2. Pick Metrics that Align Your Goals<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Depending on what you aim to achieve, you will determine how to measure it. For instance, if your goal is to enhance customer experience, you might measure the number of return customers, monitor brand awareness, or assess net promoter scores. Suppose you plan to adopt a digital workplace. In that case, you may want to track the number of applications your employees switch between and evaluate whether this affects efficiency or causes distractions that lead to errors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Step 3. Get Down to Measuring Business<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">With a clear set of objectives and an allocated budget to reach them, you can begin evaluating the results. This involves examining whether your current state aligns with your desired objectives. The chosen metrics will be tools for measuring progress, even if the goals initially seem abstract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">To illustrate this, let&#8217;s consider an example of measuring ROI within the HR department of a large organization, as presented by Forbes. Suppose they aim to automate the vacation request process to increase operational efficiency. Now, the manual process takes 75 hours of employee time each month. Appropriate digital tools can reduce this time to 15 hours per month. The goal is clear and measurable, making it easy to see if you&#8217;ve hit the mark. By estimating the ROI of this objective, you can get a better sense of the bigger picture and evaluate the overall efficiency of the digital changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-color=\"transparent\">Top KPIs to Measure Your Success<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are the compass that will guide your digital metamorphosis.\u00a0Tracking these KPIs is essential for ensuring a successful digital transformation. KPIs are the lighthouse that helps you see if you&#8217;re navigating in the right direction or need to change course to achieve business growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">There are no one-size-fits-all instructions for<\/span> any successful digital transformation strategies<span data-color=\"transparent\">. However, here are some key areas to anchor your focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">This indicator will show if your money to attract new customers aligns with your objectives and budget. It&#8217;s one of the essential gauges during the digital transformation process, as it shows the cost-effectiveness of your tech solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Customer Satisfaction and Retention<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/salesforce.com\/research\/customer-expectations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-color=\"transparent\">76% of customers\u00a0<\/span><\/a><span data-color=\"transparent\">believe that companies should understand their<\/span> customer expectations,<span data-color=\"transparent\"> and needs. Measuring customer satisfaction and retention is like checking the pulse of your business to see if you&#8217;re meeting client demands with your new digital mindset. You can track this through customer satisfaction scores or the percentage of repeat purchases.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Net Promoter Score (NPS)<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Determining NPS is important for seeing long-term business growth influenced by transformation. Simply put, you want to know if your customers would recommend your company to a friend. Regular surveys can help you monitor whether this number is on the rise.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Percentage of Product Defects<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">One of the key goals of automation through digital transformation is to reduce errors from manual operations. It&#8217;s important to evaluate if the AI or ML solutions you&#8217;ve implemented are truly effective. Measure this KPI by taking the number of faulty products, the total number produced, and seeing if the defect rate decreases with new digital solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Revenue Growth Rate<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Likely, one of the most desired KPIs. This metric shows the speed at which your business income is growing. The goal is to boost revenue quickly, as it&#8217;s the lifeline of any venture. Achieving revenue growth requires attracting new customers and ensuring past customers return.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Process Downtime Level<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">This indicator is valuable for companies automating processes and operations. It reveals if the time lost due to tech problems or employee absences has decreased thanks to new tech solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"widt9\">What Are the Challenges of Digital Transformation?<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-21155\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Challenges of Digital Transformation\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-600x401.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-450x300.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Challenges-of-Digital-Transformation-min-1000x668.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">While 85% of enterprise decision-makers believe they have a limited time frame of two years for successful in-depth digital transformation, many view this metamorphosis as daunting and quite challenging.

One effective way to find common ground is to gather feedback from all departments and ensure that employees share the values of a new digital mindset.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Integrating legacy and digital assets<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">One of the main challenges is overcoming doubts about whether a business needs new tech tools when it has already invested heavily in its legacy programming. The transformation aims to link the<\/span> many legacy systems<span data-color=\"transparent\"> with new digital tools and scale up the existing technology to improve the business.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Facing digital change fears<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">The overload of tech-savvy solutions may intimidate employees. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to invest time in training them to work with new technology. Their fears will disappear once workers see that advanced technology helps them do their jobs and become more efficient.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Managing risks of digital infrastructure<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">With new opportunities come new risks. On the one hand, each employee-owned device is a portal into a corporate<\/span> digital data<span data-color=\"transparent\"> store. On the other hand, digital tools allow a company to reinforce data security. Digitized security systems ensure that online assets are better protected, and cloud computing risks are more accessible to identify and handle.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Getting lost trying to keep up with all the current trends<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">The last but not least challenge is to avoid getting lost in a chaotic bouncing from one trend to another. That is why the only way to overcome this hurdle is to have a well-thought-out framework for your transformation. To avoid getting stuck in the mish-mash of solutions trying to keep up with the ever-changing digital environment, you&#8217;ll need to have a blueprint and always focus on the final goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-color=\"transparent\">Digital Transformation Framework: The Guidelines<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Well-defined digital transformation strategies are essential for navigating the complexities. With no plan, a company is doomed to get trapped in the middle of digital metamorphosis, as it is only possible to adapt to new technology and trends appearing daily with a strict outline of actions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">For this reason, before getting down to business, any organization needs to set up a digital transformation framework that will both serve as a guideline and always keep the focus on the final goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">There is no existing one-size-fits-all framework businesses can apply to, as every company outlines a plan specific to its needs, requirements, and values.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">As the digital changing process is not indivisible, there are four basic frameworks that you can customize for your company:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Processes and Operations<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Some companies want to boost customer experience, lower production costs, or increase quality. The objectives may be various, though the means to achieve them can be clearly defined. Incorporating new technology may significantly enhance a company&#8217;s processes and operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">For instance, Airbus uses display glasses to improve the quality of employees inspecting the planes. Domino&#8217;s Pizza enables the order process from any device, thus overtaking Pizza Hut in sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">While the goals are different\u2014Airbus focuses on enhancing the quality and safety of its products, while Domino&#8217;s aims to improve customer experience and increase sales\u2014the means are the same: transforming old processes and operations with new tech solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Business Model Transformation<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">This area of transformation requires a fresh outlook on how value is delivered in the industry and within your company. Examples include Netflix reimagining its business model from an outdated DVD rental company to a leading media-services provider and production company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Another example is Apple reinventing music delivery with iTunes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">As you&#8217;ve probably noticed, all the verbs have the prefix&#8217; re,&#8217; indicating that companies take their existing models andopen new opportunities for business growth by repeatedly launching fresh initiatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Changing how a company delivers value to users and customers requires strong leadership, active involvement, and well-thought-out strategic planning from the Strategy and Business departments. It also needs the courage to take risks on the path to something new.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Domain Transformation<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">The allure of digital transformation is that with its endless opportunities, the sky is the limit. A business can successfully create a new source of revenue by venturing into an entirely new industry. Take Amazon, for example. They boldly entered a new market by launching Amazon Web Services (AWS), offering cloud computing services. This was remarkable, as IT giants like Microsoft and IBM predominantly owned the domain. However, the unique opportunities of tech solutions, their strong digital capabilities, and exceptionally brave thinking have enabled AWS now to contribute 60% of Amazon&#8217;s annual profit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">It goes without saying that companies like Amazon are better able to leverage new technology and expand into new domains more quickly. Still, technologies like AI, ML, UX, IoT, and AR show that a business can unlock new growth cost-effectively and efficiently. Therefore, explore new domains and see whether your company can benefit from these unlocked opportunities<\/span> for competitive advantage<span data-color=\"transparent\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-color=\"transparent\">Cultural and Organization Transformation<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Many companies focus on cultural change by adopting digital values without making real changes<\/span> to business culture<span data-color=\"transparent\">. To transform, change your company culture, and embrace new skills and technologies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">You need solid and clear initiatives to update workflows and bring in new value by changing old habits. Teaching employees about decentralized decision-making is only worthwhile if they feel heard. Similarly, manual tasks should only be replaced if the new automated processes are actually better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">In short, cultural change alone won&#8217;t drive business success. However, when combined with effective tech solutions, it can lead to continuous growth. So, when planning cultural changes, ensure they&#8217;re part of a bigger digital transformation strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-color=\"transparent\">Digital transformation has quickly gone from an unknown term to a buzzword. Technologies like Cloud Computing, IoT, Blockchain, AI, and AR are now part of everyday business language and operations. Yet, figuring out the right path for your business can still be confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><em><span data-color=\"transparent\">That&#8217;s where we come in.
