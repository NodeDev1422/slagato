Planning and preparing are the only ways to ensure your migration efforts don\u2019t become part of these statistics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving off-prem and into the cloud requires a lot of careful groundwork and strategy. The planning and preparation stage is your initial roadmap and is created specifically to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/cloud-migration-risks\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prevent typical gotchas<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while keeping business objectives and uptime in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Assessing Cloud Migration Readiness<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you can start, you\u2019ll need to take a moment to size up your current operation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding the full extent of what cloud migration entails begins with a meticulous examination of your present infrastructure setup.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what it will look like:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Evaluate Existing Infrastructure<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Begin by cataloging your on-premise landscape. Which systems are operating, and how do they interact?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking this step is essential as it allows for the identification of snags and informs decisions about necessary adjustments. Consistent adherence to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cloud migration best practices<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can pave the way for a frictionless shift.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Prioritize Applications and Servers<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every application holds the same value or complexity level. Sifting through them meticulously will show you which should head to the front line based on strategic significance, intricacy, as well as anticipated advantages of making such moves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aim to complete early stages with straightforward yet impactful applications. These initial successes foster confidence and set the pace for future ventures.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Develop a Comprehensive Migration Plan<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your migration plan is more than just an itinerary. It outlines each part of your migration journey while being mindful of dependencies along with potential stumbling blocks en route.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embracing increments rather than immediately overhauling everything tends to yield better results\u2014think precision over haste here.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Developing a <\/b><b>Cloud Migration Strategy<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constructing a sound <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cloud migration strategy<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the cornerstone of a seamless transition to the cloud. Here is an outline for forging such a plan with efficacy:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Define a Clear Strategy<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud migration techniques and formats aren\u2019t set in stone. In fact, they\u2019re quite fluid depending on the unique structure your on-prem systems already take.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your setup, there are several pathways that form the basis of your overall migration strategy. These are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Life and Shift<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Quick and straightforward, this approach is ideal for migrating applications that require minimal intervention and changes. It\u2019s cost-effective and reduces the time required to implement the change. However, larger and more complex infrastructure generally cannot be migrated this way.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Rearchitect: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A more time-consuming process, this strategy is suited for more complex environments where existing on-prem applications and services are redesigned to fully take advantage of cloud capabilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Hybrid Approach<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Sometimes, on-prem systems just cannot be migrated. In the real world, legacy systems, security compliance, and low local latency requirements just won\u2019t allow it. This strategy combines on-premises and cloud environments, providing a more flexible option.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not the 2010s anymore, and a pure on-premises environment is pretty rare, save for mission-critical infrastructure or when data sovereignty compliance (keeping data contained within a geographic location) is crucial.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Establish a Baseline<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retaining local latency can be one of the biggest <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cloud migration challenges<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Users are used to a certain speed and processing time, and you\u2019ll need to maintain (or improve) it. Establish a performance baseline that will allow you to compare the pre-migration and post-migration metrics.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you understand your current performance, you\u2019ll help identify areas for improvement and address existing issues at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Identify and Address Risks<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best practices of cloud migration<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> strategy is identifying all potential risks early on. Factors such as data loss, downtimes, security breaches, and just unhappy users should all form the framework of your initial strategy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Develop a migration strategy that addresses these risks head-on. As new issues arise\u2014which they will\u2014update the risk management plan as you move along.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 800;\">Choosing the Right Cloud Provider<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing a provider to host your data and applications in the cloud is a decision that should align with your business goals and objectives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selection of the provider is a core point in your migration strategy, so research what is available and how to manage migration to their services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27803 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/cloud-infrastructure-revenue-1024x766.png\" alt=\"Cloud-infrastructure\" width=\"1024\" height=\"766\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/cloud-infrastructure-revenue-1024x766.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/cloud-infrastructure-revenue-300x224.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/cloud-infrastructure-revenue-768x574.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/cloud-infrastructure-revenue-1536x1149.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/cloud-infrastructure-revenue-600x449.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/cloud-infrastructure-revenue-450x336.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/cloud-infrastructure-revenue-1000x748.png 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/cloud-infrastructure-revenue.png 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resource: <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/18819\/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statista<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, there is a huge variety of providers, from Digital Ocean to Alibaba and Oracle.

Many businesses opt for AWS to implement the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best practices for secure cloud migration,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while Google Cloud provides medium enterprises with advanced data analysis and machine learning capabilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider these factors in relation to your business goals to kickstart your cloud migration strategy successfully.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 800;\">The Cloud Migration Process<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a structured process is your best bet to help streamline the transition. Typically, businesses and their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/technologies\/cloud-computing-solutions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">development partners<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will follow a five-step approach to ensure a successful migration:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Assessment and Planning<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by evaluating your existing applications and data. Recognize any dependencies, performance needs, and obstacles that may arise during migration. Develop a migration strategy that focuses on tasks according to their complexity and significance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Proof of Concept<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data migration to cloud best practices<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, initiate a non-critical workload to establish a preliminary demonstration. This enables you to evaluate the transfer process, recognize any challenges, and fine-tune your strategy prior to expanding operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Phased Migration<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Move applications and data in stages to reduce any disturbances. Start with less critical systems and gradually proceed to more crucial applications. This gradual method helps maintain business operations and allows for last-minute adjustments.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Use of Cloud-Native Services<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use cloud-based services and automation tools to simplify the migration process. These tools help automate tasks, maintain data accuracy, and minimize work. Employing services such as AWS Database Migration Service, Azure Migrate, or Google Cloud Migrate for Compute Engine can greatly facilitate the transition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Testing and Validation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the completion of each migration stage, it is crucial to test and validate the transferred applications and data. Confirm that all components operate as expected, performance meets benchmarks, and data integrity is maintained. Address any issues promptly before moving on to the next phase.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 800;\">Ensuring Security and Governance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latency, performance, and cost are all things that demand attention in your strategy plan. But the most crucial facet of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">migration to cloud best practices<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is strong data and cyber security, and data privacy and sovereignty compliance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When migrating to the cloud, here are the key steps to follow:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Implement and Emphasize Security Measures<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The integrity of your cloud-based data is the bedrock of client and user trust. To ensure your cloud-based data remains just as safe as your on-prem data, implement (at a minimum) data at rest and transit encryption, multi-factor authentication, and routine security audits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your cloud provider likely has these tools built in, so ingrain them into your migration strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Establish a Clear Cloud Governance Model<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Migrating to the cloud is an ideal time to review and implement current data and access governance. When reviewing and renewing ACLs, include policies for data management, access control, and resource usage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clear governance policy prevents unauthorized access and ensures the cloud environment is consistently managed. Tools such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/organizations\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AWS Organizations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/governance\/policy\/overview\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Azure Policy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (AD Group Policy in the cloud), and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/resource-manager\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Cloud Resource Manager<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> all have different rules-based syntax. Be sure to understand them when renewing governance policy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Requirements<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compliance with local and international industry standards is critical. Identify regulations regarding data privacy, security, and sovereignty, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hhs.gov\/hipaa\/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GDPR<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hhs.gov\/hipaa\/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HIPAA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/platforms\/healthcare-it-solutions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">healthcare industry<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voluntary frameworks such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aicpa-cima.com\/topic\/audit-assurance\/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SOC 2<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s likely your cloud provider is aware of the regulations and enforces compliance. However, you should still conduct regular audits with the tools and frameworks provided by your cloud service.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 800;\">Testing and Validation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In cloud migration, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/qa-and-software-testing-services\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">testing and validation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aren\u2019t reserved for the finish line. Rather, they are ongoing processes and essential for a successful migration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how to approach testing and validation:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Test, Retest, Test Again<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Functional testing, performance testing, and security testing must be performed throughout the migration process to ensure everything works as expected. Targets will include applications (server and client), infrastructure, data ingress and egress, and user experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Data Integrity and Security Validation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing of data migration and storage processes is important. Validate that data integrity has been maintained during and after the migration and that security measures are actively protecting data. Backup legacy data pre-migration in case everything goes sideways and recovery is required.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Retain Test, Dev, and Prod Environments<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like your on-prem environment, segment cloud infrastructure into test, development, and production.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Test<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Mirrors the production environment to simulate real-world updates, upgrades, and environment changes.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Dev<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Developers can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/cloud-computing-in-software-development\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experiment and innovate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> without risking production stability and functionality.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Prod<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Your main operating environment. Once tests are passed, deployment to production can be performed with confidence, knowing it has been validated in the test environment.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This segmentation functions exactly like your existing testing environments but is much more easily implemented in the cloud.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 800;\">Monitoring and Optimization<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A successful data and applications migration is cause for celebration, but the work doesn\u2019t stop there. Your new cloud-based system requires continuous monitoring and optimization of available resources to continue to function just as your on-prem infrastructure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how to ensure your cloud setup remains efficient and is ready to be scaled:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Performance and Scalability<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User demand fluctuates, meaning you must be ready to meet demand peaks. Ensure your cloud environment is up to the task by using the cloud-native tools available from your provider to track resource utilization, application performance, and overall system health.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Cost Efficiency<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overestimating resources is a common issue with newly migrated systems. Review your cloud spending regularly to identify and reduce inefficiencies. Optimize resource allocation and scaling policies to eliminate over-provisioning and claim back operational costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Cloud-Native Services and Automation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your cloud provider has inbuilt tools that allow you to perform monitoring and optimization. Tools such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/autoscaling\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AWS Auto Scaling<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/automation\/overview\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Azure Automation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/compute\/docs\/autoscaler\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Cloud Autoscaler<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> automatically adjust resources based on load and demand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Factor the use of the tools into your migration planning to ensure optimal performance and cost management.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 800;\">Post-Migration Activities<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the completion of the cloud migration (and subsequent celebrations), it\u2019s time to focus on post-migration activities, with a focus on managing change and fostering resilience and pushback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the key steps to manage this phase effectively and ensure the ongoing success and stability:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Stakeholder Consideration<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The needs and expectations of your users, customers, vendors, and partners require careful consideration. Change is harder for some people to cope with than others. Make sure you communicate clearly and frequently to ensure all stakeholders are informed and on board with the new cloud environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Strong Maintenance Plan<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For teams managing a new environment, implement a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/software-maintenance-support\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comprehensive maintenance plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to keep your cloud environment running as smoothly as possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with on-prem, regular updates, patches, and performance tuning are still essential for maintaining your system&#8217;s efficiency and security.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Automate Runbooks<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to efficient cloud operations is automation. Automate runbooks to empower your IT teams to respond fast to incidents without introducing the risks you faced with your on-prem environment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This level of automation will ultimately reduce the need for overtime and allow your team to concentrate on bringing further innovation to your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 800;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful migration to the cloud requires careful planning, strategic execution, and ongoing maintenance and optimization.
