By prioritizing client needs without compromising on profit. In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at the future of business banking and how adopting certain business models can help you be at the forefront of future banking trends.<\/p>\n<h2>Future Business Models and Competitive Arenas in Business Banking<\/h2>\n<p>In the ever-changing business landscape, banking institutions have to fight to stay relevant. According to EIU\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eiu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">financial outlook 2023 report<\/a>, fintech and cryptocurrency sellers will find it harder to weather the storm.<\/p>\n<p>Adapting to your new reality isn\u2019t always easy, but adjusting your business model is one way of keeping abreast of the latest developments.<\/p>\n<p>Banks that are open to change can benefit directly from disruptions \u201cby combining their unparalleled domain expertise, reputation, and relationships with innovations in technology and a client-centric approach,\u201d said Dr. Christian Thun while writing for Moody\u2019s Analytics <a href=\"https:\/\/www.moodysanalytics.com\/risk-perspectives-magazine\/risk-management-decade-ahead\/rethinking-risk-management\/five-challenges-for-the-business-model-bank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Risk Management: The Decade Ahead<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFortunately, the business banking sector has proven its resilience over the past decade by bolstering their capital and liquidity positions, and leaving behind non-core activities and markets,\u201d EIU\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eiu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">financial outlook 2023 report<\/a> found.<\/p>\n<p>It also sets up the sector for benefiting from future trends by improving digital services, becoming more financially inclusive, and investing in sustainable banking services.<\/p>\n<p>So, what will business banking look like in the future?<\/p>\n<p>Accenture\u2019s Global Banking Lead <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accenture.com\/us-en\/insights\/banking\/top-10-trends-banking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Abbott<\/a>\u2019s predictions could soon become a reality. According to him, business and corporate banks\u2019 innovative products could mirror that of the Amazon Prime model.<\/p>\n<p>Just like mobile platforms, banks will take a dip into the metaverse, which will open a world of possibilities, but Abbott warns this won\u2019t be without risk.<\/p>\n<p>As a way of outperforming their peers, banks must help their clients solve their problems rather than increase their customer base. This taps into the notion of \u201clife centricity\u201d, whereby institutions take a holistic approach to customer wellbeing.<\/p>\n<p>Abbott also believes data should be viewed as a product \u201cthat has the potential to transform the foundations of banking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sas.com\/en\/whitepapers\/banking-in-2035-global-banking-survey-report-113203.html?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=rsk-gen-gbc-edn-emea&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw586hBhBrEiwAQYEnHTg8ZknTq1bDeaNXh2NdcL2FjF1KOdHFDVEfSsjXd_HGsOq03hJHrhoCkNcQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Banking in 2035: global banking survey report<\/a> mirrored Abbott\u2019s predictions when listing its most important outcomes for banks over the coming decade, with improved cybersecurity and data protection leading the pack with 46%.<\/p>\n<h2>The Impact of Data and Money Regulation on Business Banking<\/h2>\n<p>Banking regulations are a way of enforcing rules to protect the client, ensure financial stability and prevent financial crime. By design, they ensure sound banking practices.<\/p>\n<p>Who regulates the banking system? In the US, four federal agencies have been tasked with this duty, namely the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve System, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.<\/p>\n<p>Easier access to data has become a building block for successful business practices, and a way of doing this is via application programming interfaces. APIs have been utilized in the banking sector for years, even more so in recent times.<\/p>\n<p>But like other innovations, data sharing raises questions around privacy and regulations in the digital market.<\/p>\n<p>The 2007-2009 financial crisis was a huge eye-opener for banks, prompting governments to install their own initiatives.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/daf\/competition\/digital-disruption-in-financial-markets.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OECD<\/a> cited an example of this with the 2015 EU Payment Services Directive II (PSD2) &#8211; a regulation that aims to enhance competition by granting open access to certain types of customer banking data for nonbank licensed providers.<\/p>\n<p>During its research into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/competition\/digital-disruption-in-banking-and-its-impact-on-competition-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digital Disruption in Banking and its Impact on Competition<\/a>, the NPO mentioned how Japan revised its Banking Act in 2017 to include provisions encouraging banks to open their APIs and facilitating banks\u2019 acquisition of or collaboration with FinTech firms.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, banks can leverage their digital technologies in response to regulatory authorities\u2019 questions by improving both regulation and supervision and, in turn, helping regulators and firms decrease the costs of compliance, OECD recommended.<\/p>\n<h2>Implementing Digital Transformation for Business Banking<\/h2>\n<p>Customer expectations are growing, and so too should your business if you want to grow with them.<\/p>\n<p>Digital transformation is a given when it comes to business banking. By taking advantage of the huge data pool, businesses can automate processes and reduce costs.<\/p>\n<p>Simple changes such as AI, cloud technology, and automation can help improve services and functionality, resulting in customer loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>Below are the key drivers to consider when going digital:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-26546\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-The-Future-of-Business-Banking-1024x809.jpg\" alt=\"Implementing transformation in business banking\" width=\"1024\" height=\"809\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-The-Future-of-Business-Banking-1024x809.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-The-Future-of-Business-Banking-300x237.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-The-Future-of-Business-Banking-768x606.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-The-Future-of-Business-Banking-1536x1213.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-The-Future-of-Business-Banking-600x474.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-The-Future-of-Business-Banking-450x355.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-The-Future-of-Business-Banking-1000x790.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-The-Future-of-Business-Banking.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Customer Needs<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s where data aggregation takes the lead. It can be challenging at times, but analyzing it leads to a clearer understanding of who your customer is and your targeted audience.<\/p>\n<p>When segmenting your strategy, consider the following: Which products are generating the most profit? Which of your digital services mostly appeal to your customer? Which new offerings could encourage growth?<\/p>\n<p>The intention here is to offer digital services via targeted marketing.<\/p>\n<h3>Cloud-based Systems<\/h3>\n<p>Previously, business banking was only sought out by big corporations and brands. It was associated with companies that had clout behind their names. Today, the environment is fast-changing and becoming accessible and inclusionary.<\/p>\n<p>With a complete <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cloud\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cloud-based system,<\/a> banks can close the socio-economic gap by offering full access and functionality to clients, from loan applications to international money transfers.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are setbacks to using this type of technology. Old legacy software systems might not be adaptable to comply with new software. The challenge coming with this is the huge costs involved to ensure a fully integrable system.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, there is a workaround &#8211; some cloud-based technologies are consumption-based, meaning clients can experiment with them before doing a complete rollout.<\/p>\n<h3>Compliance Ready<\/h3>\n<p>Regulatory requirements are growing steadily, and to make sure your systems are compliant, you need to keep up-to-date of the latest rules and regulations governing the banking sector.<\/p>\n<p>Dismissing these could lead to costly repercussions, which could easily have been avoided.<\/p>\n<h3>Security<\/h3>\n<p>In June 2022, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/tech\/services-and-software\/social-security-numbers-stolen-in-flagstar-bank-data-breach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flagstar Bank<\/a>, one of the USA\u2019s largest financial providers, fell victim to a massive data breach whereby the Social Security numbers of almost 1.5 million customers were leaked.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, the bank failed to disclose how cybercriminals hacked into the system, but investigations showed that the attack may have happened as early as December 2021, highlighting the urgent need for ransomware protection.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/news\/2022\/feb\/20\/credit-suisse-secrets-leak-unmasks-criminals-fraudsters-corrupt-politicians\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Credit Sussie<\/a> data leak from February 2022 saw the details of accounts linked to 30 000 of its clients leaked. This resulted in one of the world\u2019s biggest private banks having to do brand damage control after it was discovered some of its clients built their wealth on drug trafficking, money laundering, and corruption.<\/p>\n<h2>Building the Future of Banking<\/h2>\n<p>Overall, banks should future-proof themselves by investing in products that give them a competitive edge. This doesn\u2019t only apply to business banking; commercial banks are finding themselves in the same boat, jostling for a larger clientele.<\/p>\n<p>Major trends are reshaping the industry, forcing the sector to evolve instead of fighting against the current. The good news is that digital business banking has embraced rapid change, considering the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns the world is currently experiencing.<\/p>\n<p>Australian author <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiley.com\/en-us\/Innovation+and+the+Future+Proof+Bank%3A+A+Practical+Guide+to+Doing+Different+Business+as+Usual-p-9780470685211\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">James A.
