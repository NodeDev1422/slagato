In <\/span>Part 1 <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of this article, we took a look back at our journey \u2014 starting with the opening of our Oslo entity, which really anchored us in the region. We also shared some insights into the value we bring to our clients and what we\u2019ve observed about the Norwegian tech landscape over the years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <\/span>Part 2<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we\u2019re diving into the heart of it \u2014 what we can do for you. We\u2019ll walk you through the innovative solutions we offer and the cutting-edge technologies we use to help our clients grow their businesses. Let\u2019s explore how we can drive you forward in this fast-evolving digital world.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Can SlagatoDo for You?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We love staying ahead of the curve, always finding the right technology to perfectly fit each business. After all, what works for one company might not be the best for another \u2014 that\u2019s why we tailor our approach to fit your unique needs. As such, our expertise spans from modernizing\/ re-engineering legacy systems to building custom software solutions from the ground up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know that every client\u2019s needs are unique, which is why we offer flexible, custom engagement models. Whether you need a dedicated team fully focused on your project or just the right specialists with targeted expertise, we\u2019ve got you covered. With a team of developers and engineers, bringing years of experience across various industries, we deliver solutions that are scalable, secure, and future-ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at a few examples of how our solutions have helped clients achieve their business goals and drive growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Modernizing and Re-engineering Existing Systems<\/b><\/h3>\n<h4><strong>Event Management Portal<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every so often, businesses reach that point where they realize their systems need a refresh. Technology evolves, and so must their systems to meet the growing demands of the business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the case for one of our clients, an event management portal, that needed to simplify the process for event organizers. After a series of on-site workshops in Norway, we developed several solutions: migrating their platform from the .NET framework to the modern Angular, introducing new features to enhance the user experience, and streamlining registration and payment processes. We also simplified the event setup process and improved the registration page model.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Custom Solution for a Dental Laboratory<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A network of dental labs in Norway partnered with us to modernize and stabilize their existing system, keeping pace with their growing business needs. They envisioned a scalable, high-performance solution that would simplify workflows for employees and enhance the user experience for dentists. Improved communication between subcontractors, labs, dentists, and logistics was crucial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slagatodeveloped a comprehensive web application for lab employees and two mobile apps \u2014 one for dentists and another for logistics. Key features included Electronic Medical Records (EMR), 3D Scanner Integration, Automated Reminders, and an Analytics Module. We upgraded their frontend from Java to Angular and built the mobile apps in React Native, vastly improving performance and usability.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Mobile and Web Application to Meet Your Requirement\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<h4><strong>Event Mobile Application\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Norway\u2019s most beloved sports events needed a digital guide to enhance the experience for its guests, and time was of the essence \u2014 they needed the app developed within just one month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our team delivered a mobile app that included all essential event information, from schedules to navigation, with a clean, user-friendly design. The app allowed guests to access everything they needed. It made the event more interactive, sustainable, and enjoyable without relying on signs and printed materials.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Web Application For a Brain Science Startup<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our client, an award-winning health-tech company in the neuroscience space, came to us with a few interesting challenges. They needed a seamless, stress-free way for new customers to get started. They also wanted detailed reports featuring interactive 3D brain models that offer users unique insights into their brain health. To add to that, they needed a simple solution to manage users and service orders through an intuitive admin panel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We stepped in and developed a user-friendly customer portal optimized for mobile devices and tablets. Now, users can easily sign up, order services, and make payments with just a few taps. Customers can also explore interactive 3D brain models to better understand how different factors affect their brain health. For the admin team, we created an intuitive back-office panel that makes managing customers and orders at its finest!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Leveraging AI to Enhance Solutions<\/b><\/h3>\n<h4><strong>AI-Enhanced Content Aggregator Platform<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the perfect video content shouldn\u2019t be a hassle. That\u2019s why our client partnered with Slagato to develop an AI-driven content aggregator that simplifies and personalizes the search process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We built a desktop app with a user-friendly interface, a personalized homepage, and features like integrated search, playlists, and custom content selection for a superior user experience. The backend, built on the Java Technical Stack, ensures strong performance, while React and React Native power a cost-efficient frontend across platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We integrated ChatGPT-driven search to make finding movies even easier, letting users search by keywords or descriptions from vague memories. The smart algorithm gathers input and presents a list of results, highlighting the most affordable or free streaming options.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Business Intelligence Platform<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A leading dental products marketplace came to us with the need to upgrade their BI system, originally built on Tableau. They required real-time insights and greater customization for system administrators, making it clear that new technology was important to meet their growing demands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a thorough evaluation, we implemented Amazon QuickSight, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a machine learning-powered business intelligence service,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> chosen for its advanced analytics capabilities. Within a few months, we launched a powerful reporting system. It offers real-time insights customized to different user groups, improves performance analysis, and customer segmentation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To push the boundaries further, we integrated AI-driven predictive models through Amazon SageMaker, leveling up forecasting accuracy and delivering more actionable insights.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Looking Ahead: Partnering for the Future<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Norwegian businesses continue to embrace digital transformation, Slagatois here to support you every step of the way.
