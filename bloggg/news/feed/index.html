										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the year comes to a close, we want to take a moment to thank you for your trust and partnership throughout 2024. It’s been a remarkable journey, and we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished together.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This holiday season is the perfect time to reflect on the milestones that shaped our year—global expansion, key partnerships, industry achievements, and enhanced capabilities. Read on to celebrate these moments with us.</span></p>
<h3><b>Global Expansion </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, we expanded our reach to better support our clients, launching new operations across LatAm and APAC in:</span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baku, Azerbaijan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manila, Philippines </span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we celebrate 7 incredible years in the Norwegian market, we can’t help but reflect on what we&#8217;ve accomplished so far. In </span>Part 1 <span style="font-weight: 400;">of this article, we took a look back at our journey — starting with the opening of our Oslo entity, which really anchored us in the region. We also shared some insights into the value we bring to our clients and what we’ve observed about the Norwegian tech landscape over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span>Part 2<span style="font-weight: 400;">, we’re diving into the heart of it — what we can do for you. We’ll walk you through the innovative solutions we offer and the cutting-edge technologies we use to help our clients grow their businesses. Let’s explore how we can drive you forward in this fast-evolving digital world.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Can SlagatoDo for You?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We love staying ahead of the curve, always finding the right technology to perfectly fit each business. After all, what works for one company might not be the best for another — that’s why we tailor our approach to fit your unique needs. As such, our expertise spans from modernizing/ re-engineering legacy systems to building custom software solutions from the ground up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that every client’s needs are unique, which is why we offer flexible, custom engagement models. Whether you need a dedicated team fully focused on your project or just the right specialists with targeted expertise, we’ve got you covered. With a team of developers and engineers, bringing years of experience across various industries, we deliver solutions that are scalable, secure, and future-ready.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s take a closer look at a few examples of how our solutions have helped clients achieve their business goals and drive growth.</span></p>
<h3><b>Modernizing and Re-engineering Existing Systems</b></h3>
<h4><strong>Event Management Portal</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every so often, businesses reach that point where they realize their systems need a refresh. Technology evolves, and so must their systems to meet the growing demands of the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the case for one of our clients, an event management portal, that needed to simplify the process for event organizers. After a series of on-site workshops in Norway, we developed several solutions: migrating their platform from the .NET framework to the modern Angular, introducing new features to enhance the user experience, and streamlining registration and payment processes. We also simplified the event setup process and improved the registration page model.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Custom Solution for a Dental Laboratory</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A network of dental labs in Norway partnered with us to modernize and stabilize their existing system, keeping pace with their growing business needs. They envisioned a scalable, high-performance solution that would simplify workflows for employees and enhance the user experience for dentists. Improved communication between subcontractors, labs, dentists, and logistics was crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slagatodeveloped a comprehensive web application for lab employees and two mobile apps — one for dentists and another for logistics. Key features included Electronic Medical Records (EMR), 3D Scanner Integration, Automated Reminders, and an Analytics Module. We upgraded their frontend from Java to Angular and built the mobile apps in React Native, vastly improving performance and usability.</span></p>
<h3><b>Mobile and Web Application to Meet Your Requirement </b></h3>
<h4><strong>Event Mobile Application </strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Norway’s most beloved sports events needed a digital guide to enhance the experience for its guests, and time was of the essence — they needed the app developed within just one month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team delivered a mobile app that included all essential event information, from schedules to navigation, with a clean, user-friendly design. The app allowed guests to access everything they needed. It made the event more interactive, sustainable, and enjoyable without relying on signs and printed materials.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Web Application For a Brain Science Startup</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our client, an award-winning health-tech company in the neuroscience space, came to us with a few interesting challenges. They needed a seamless, stress-free way for new customers to get started. They also wanted detailed reports featuring interactive 3D brain models that offer users unique insights into their brain health. To add to that, they needed a simple solution to manage users and service orders through an intuitive admin panel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We stepped in and developed a user-friendly customer portal optimized for mobile devices and tablets. Now, users can easily sign up, order services, and make payments with just a few taps. Customers can also explore interactive 3D brain models to better understand how different factors affect their brain health. For the admin team, we created an intuitive back-office panel that makes managing customers and orders at its finest!</span></p>
<h3><b>Leveraging AI to Enhance Solutions</b></h3>
<h4><strong>AI-Enhanced Content Aggregator Platform</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the perfect video content shouldn’t be a hassle. That’s why our client partnered with Slagato to develop an AI-driven content aggregator that simplifies and personalizes the search process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We built a desktop app with a user-friendly interface, a personalized homepage, and features like integrated search, playlists, and custom content selection for a superior user experience. The backend, built on the Java Technical Stack, ensures strong performance, while React and React Native power a cost-efficient frontend across platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We integrated ChatGPT-driven search to make finding movies even easier, letting users search by keywords or descriptions from vague memories. The smart algorithm gathers input and presents a list of results, highlighting the most affordable or free streaming options.</span></p>
<p><strong>Business Intelligence Platform</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A leading dental products marketplace came to us with the need to upgrade their BI system, originally built on Tableau. They required real-time insights and greater customization for system administrators, making it clear that new technology was important to meet their growing demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a thorough evaluation, we implemented Amazon QuickSight, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a machine learning-powered business intelligence service,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chosen for its advanced analytics capabilities. Within a few months, we launched a powerful reporting system. It offers real-time insights customized to different user groups, improves performance analysis, and customer segmentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To push the boundaries further, we integrated AI-driven predictive models through Amazon SageMaker, leveling up forecasting accuracy and delivering more actionable insights.</span></p>
<h2><b>Looking Ahead: Partnering for the Future</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Norwegian businesses continue to embrace digital transformation, Slagatois here to support you every step of the way. With over 17 years of global experience and 600+ custom solutions delivered, our deep understanding of the local market, combined with our worldwide expertise, makes us as your go-to strategic partner for navigating the digital age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re looking to modernize an existing platform, optimize your operations, or develop a new digital solution, Slagato technology’s team is ready to assist. With our entity in Oslo and a proven track record of success with Norwegian clients and beyond the region, we’re committed to helping you strengthen your legacy, achieve your goals, and unlock new opportunities.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slagatomarks its 7-year presence in the Norwegian market. Over these years, we’ve had the amazing opportunity to work with esteemed Norwegian companies across various industries, helping them strengthen their potential through digitization and custom solutions. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d love to take a moment to reflect on how our journey began and share our key takeaways.</span></i></p>
<h2><b>How It Began </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The turning point in our journey was opening our entity in Oslo, which solidified our presence in the Norwegian market. This allowed us to establish a strong foothold in the region and build meaningful connections with local businesses. With a team on the ground, we have been able to conduct on-site workshops, engage directly with our clients, and truly understand the intricacies of the Norwegian market.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2><b>A Word About the Scandinavian Software Development Market</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative. Innovative. Awe-inspiring. Over the years, we’ve seen Scandinavian companies consistently prove themselves as some of the most creative, innovative and forward-thinking in the industry. From fintech to gaming, streaming media, and beyond, Scandinavia is emerging as a global powerhouse, and it’s only gaining momentum. This surge in innovation has led to a rising demand for sustainable, impactful, and scalable software solutions throughout Norway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the unique requests from our clients, we’ve been able to identify a few trends that really stand out:</span></p>
<p><b><br style="font-weight: 400;" />Need for Scalable and Flexible Solutions</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Norway, customers seek software solutions that are scalable, flexible, and easily integrated with their existing systems. They place high value on security, data privacy, and user-friendly interfaces that offer a seamless experience.</span></p>
<p><b>The Shift to Cloud-Based Solutions</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency drives another trend — the move toward cloud-based solutions, which reduces the burden of maintaining on-premise systems.</span></p>
<p><b>Automation</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen a growing demand for software that can streamline processes, increase efficiency, and minimize errors, making automation a key trend in the Norwegian region.</span></p>
<p><b>Sustainability at the Core</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known for its strong focus on sustainability and social responsibility, Norway reflects these values in a software market as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying, Norway is home to numerous innovative startups and established companies. It boasts a vibrant and dynamic software ecosystem, powered by a highly Slagato population and a strong culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Norway continues to lead with innovation, the demand for cutting-edge software solutions will only grow, positioning the region as a beacon of progress in the global tech landscape.</span></p>
<h2><b>How We Became a Trusted Partner for Norwegian Tech Community</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, we’ve gotten to know what Norwegian businesses value, which has equipped us to deliver solutions that perfectly align with our clients&#8217; goals. The Slagatoteam is always ready to step up, support you, and build strong, lasting relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to project delivery, we bring agility to the table, ensuring that our solutions are as flexible and scalable as you need them to be. Our team is a powerhouse of knowledge and innovation, blending the experience and deep technical expertise of developers and architects, while our designers infuse creativity and fresh perspectives. This synergy allows us to create robust, forward-thinking solutions that set you up for success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust, earned through transparent and honest communication, is at the heart of our philosophy. By openly addressing challenges and working closely with our clients, we build long-lasting relationships with care and support that are solid as a rock. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We extend our gratitude to our community, clients, partners, and everyone who has contributed to our success. Your support has been the cornerstone of our achievements. Together, let’s celebrate our shared journey and look forward to many more chapters of innovation, growth, and leadership in the world of digital transformation.</span></i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to migrate your existing on-prem systems to the cloud isn’t one to take lightly. With over </span><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/bloggg/corporate-cloud-data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60% of corporate data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now located in cloud-based systems, cloud migration is quickly becoming the norm and brings a unique set of challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legacy systems that refuse to budge, data that needs babysitting, and legal challenges such as data sovereignty are just a few of the speed bumps you’ll likely face—but seamless migration is possible with planning and foresight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cloud-migration-opportunity-business-value-grows-but-missteps-abound"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scary numbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Planning and preparing are the only ways to ensure your migration efforts don’t become part of these statistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving off-prem and into the cloud requires a lot of careful groundwork and strategy. The planning and preparation stage is your initial roadmap and is created specifically to </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/cloud-migration-risks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent typical gotchas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while keeping business objectives and uptime in mind.</span></p>
<h3><b>Assessing Cloud Migration Readiness</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can start, you’ll need to take a moment to size up your current operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the full extent of what cloud migration entails begins with a meticulous examination of your present infrastructure setup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what it will look like:</span></p>
<h4><b>Evaluate Existing Infrastructure</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin by cataloging your on-premise landscape. Which systems are operating, and how do they interact? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking this step is essential as it allows for the identification of snags and informs decisions about necessary adjustments. Consistent adherence to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud migration best practices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can pave the way for a frictionless shift.</span></p>
<h4><b>Prioritize Applications and Servers</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every application holds the same value or complexity level. Sifting through them meticulously will show you which should head to the front line based on strategic significance, intricacy, as well as anticipated advantages of making such moves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aim to complete early stages with straightforward yet impactful applications. These initial successes foster confidence and set the pace for future ventures.</span></p>
<h4><b>Develop a Comprehensive Migration Plan</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your migration plan is more than just an itinerary. It outlines each part of your migration journey while being mindful of dependencies along with potential stumbling blocks en route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embracing increments rather than immediately overhauling everything tends to yield better results—think precision over haste here.</span></p>
<h3><b>Developing a </b><b>Cloud Migration Strategy</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constructing a sound </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud migration strategy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the cornerstone of a seamless transition to the cloud. Here is an outline for forging such a plan with efficacy:</span></p>
<h4><b>Define a Clear Strategy</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud migration techniques and formats aren’t set in stone. In fact, they’re quite fluid depending on the unique structure your on-prem systems already take. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your setup, there are several pathways that form the basis of your overall migration strategy. These are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Life and Shift</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Quick and straightforward, this approach is ideal for migrating applications that require minimal intervention and changes. It’s cost-effective and reduces the time required to implement the change. However, larger and more complex infrastructure generally cannot be migrated this way.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Rearchitect: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more time-consuming process, this strategy is suited for more complex environments where existing on-prem applications and services are redesigned to fully take advantage of cloud capabilities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Hybrid Approach</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sometimes, on-prem systems just cannot be migrated. In the real world, legacy systems, security compliance, and low local latency requirements just won’t allow it. This strategy combines on-premises and cloud environments, providing a more flexible option.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not the 2010s anymore, and a pure on-premises environment is pretty rare, save for mission-critical infrastructure or when data sovereignty compliance (keeping data contained within a geographic location) is crucial. </span></p>
<h4><b>Establish a Baseline</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retaining local latency can be one of the biggest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud migration challenges</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Users are used to a certain speed and processing time, and you’ll need to maintain (or improve) it. Establish a performance baseline that will allow you to compare the pre-migration and post-migration metrics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you understand your current performance, you’ll help identify areas for improvement and address existing issues at the same time.</span></p>
<h4><b>Identify and Address Risks</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best practices of cloud migration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strategy is identifying all potential risks early on. Factors such as data loss, downtimes, security breaches, and just unhappy users should all form the framework of your initial strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a migration strategy that addresses these risks head-on. As new issues arise—which they will—update the risk management plan as you move along.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Choosing the Right Cloud Provider</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing a provider to host your data and applications in the cloud is a decision that should align with your business goals and objectives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selection of the provider is a core point in your migration strategy, so research what is available and how to manage migration to their services.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Azure could be an option if you are operating Active Directory and Exchange on-premises. Many businesses opt for AWS to implement the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best practices for secure cloud migration,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while Google Cloud provides medium enterprises with advanced data analysis and machine learning capabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider these factors in relation to your business goals to kickstart your cloud migration strategy successfully.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">The Cloud Migration Process</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a structured process is your best bet to help streamline the transition. Typically, businesses and their </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/technologies/cloud-computing-solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will follow a five-step approach to ensure a successful migration:</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Assessment and Planning</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by evaluating your existing applications and data. Recognize any dependencies, performance needs, and obstacles that may arise during migration. Develop a migration strategy that focuses on tasks according to their complexity and significance.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Proof of Concept</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">data migration to cloud best practices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, initiate a non-critical workload to establish a preliminary demonstration. This enables you to evaluate the transfer process, recognize any challenges, and fine-tune your strategy prior to expanding operations.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Phased Migration</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move applications and data in stages to reduce any disturbances. Start with less critical systems and gradually proceed to more crucial applications. This gradual method helps maintain business operations and allows for last-minute adjustments.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Use of Cloud-Native Services</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use cloud-based services and automation tools to simplify the migration process. These tools help automate tasks, maintain data accuracy, and minimize work. Employing services such as AWS Database Migration Service, Azure Migrate, or Google Cloud Migrate for Compute Engine can greatly facilitate the transition.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. Testing and Validation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the completion of each migration stage, it is crucial to test and validate the transferred applications and data. Confirm that all components operate as expected, performance meets benchmarks, and data integrity is maintained. Address any issues promptly before moving on to the next phase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Ensuring Security and Governance</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latency, performance, and cost are all things that demand attention in your strategy plan. But the most crucial facet of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">migration to cloud best practices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is strong data and cyber security, and data privacy and sovereignty compliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When migrating to the cloud, here are the key steps to follow:</span></p>
<h3><b>Implement and Emphasize Security Measures</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integrity of your cloud-based data is the bedrock of client and user trust. To ensure your cloud-based data remains just as safe as your on-prem data, implement (at a minimum) data at rest and transit encryption, multi-factor authentication, and routine security audits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your cloud provider likely has these tools built in, so ingrain them into your migration strategy.</span></p>
<h3><b>Establish a Clear Cloud Governance Model</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migrating to the cloud is an ideal time to review and implement current data and access governance. When reviewing and renewing ACLs, include policies for data management, access control, and resource usage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clear governance policy prevents unauthorized access and ensures the cloud environment is consistently managed. Tools such as </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS Organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (AD Group Policy in the cloud), and </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Cloud Resource Manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all have different rules-based syntax. Be sure to understand them when renewing governance policy.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Requirements</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compliance with local and international industry standards is critical. Identify regulations regarding data privacy, security, and sovereignty, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HIPAA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/healthcare-it-solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare industry</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voluntary frameworks such as </span><a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SOC 2</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s likely your cloud provider is aware of the regulations and enforces compliance. However, you should still conduct regular audits with the tools and frameworks provided by your cloud service.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Testing and Validation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cloud migration, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/qa-and-software-testing-services"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testing and validation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aren’t reserved for the finish line. Rather, they are ongoing processes and essential for a successful migration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how to approach testing and validation:</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Test, Retest, Test Again</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functional testing, performance testing, and security testing must be performed throughout the migration process to ensure everything works as expected. Targets will include applications (server and client), infrastructure, data ingress and egress, and user experience. </span></p>
<h3><b>2. Data Integrity and Security Validation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing of data migration and storage processes is important. Validate that data integrity has been maintained during and after the migration and that security measures are actively protecting data. Backup legacy data pre-migration in case everything goes sideways and recovery is required.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Retain Test, Dev, and Prod Environments</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like your on-prem environment, segment cloud infrastructure into test, development, and production. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Test</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Mirrors the production environment to simulate real-world updates, upgrades, and environment changes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Dev</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Developers can </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/cloud-computing-in-software-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experiment and innovate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without risking production stability and functionality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prod</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Your main operating environment. Once tests are passed, deployment to production can be performed with confidence, knowing it has been validated in the test environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This segmentation functions exactly like your existing testing environments but is much more easily implemented in the cloud. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Monitoring and Optimization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful data and applications migration is cause for celebration, but the work doesn’t stop there. Your new cloud-based system requires continuous monitoring and optimization of available resources to continue to function just as your on-prem infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how to ensure your cloud setup remains efficient and is ready to be scaled:</span></p>
<h3><b>Performance and Scalability</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User demand fluctuates, meaning you must be ready to meet demand peaks. Ensure your cloud environment is up to the task by using the cloud-native tools available from your provider to track resource utilization, application performance, and overall system health.</span></p>
<h3><b>Cost Efficiency</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overestimating resources is a common issue with newly migrated systems. Review your cloud spending regularly to identify and reduce inefficiencies. Optimize resource allocation and scaling policies to eliminate over-provisioning and claim back operational costs.</span></p>
<h3><b>Cloud-Native Services and Automation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your cloud provider has inbuilt tools that allow you to perform monitoring and optimization. Tools such as </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS Auto Scaling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure Automation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Cloud Autoscaler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> automatically adjust resources based on load and demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor the use of the tools into your migration planning to ensure optimal performance and cost management. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 800;">Post-Migration Activities</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the completion of the cloud migration (and subsequent celebrations), it’s time to focus on post-migration activities, with a focus on managing change and fostering resilience and pushback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the key steps to manage this phase effectively and ensure the ongoing success and stability: </span></p>
<h3><b>Stakeholder Consideration</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The needs and expectations of your users, customers, vendors, and partners require careful consideration. Change is harder for some people to cope with than others. Make sure you communicate clearly and frequently to ensure all stakeholders are informed and on board with the new cloud environment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Strong Maintenance Plan</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For teams managing a new environment, implement a </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/software-maintenance-support"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comprehensive maintenance plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep your cloud environment running as smoothly as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with on-prem, regular updates, patches, and performance tuning are still essential for maintaining your system&#8217;s efficiency and security.</span></p>
<h3><b>Automate Runbooks</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to efficient cloud operations is automation. Automate runbooks to empower your IT teams to respond fast to incidents without introducing the risks you faced with your on-prem environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This level of automation will ultimately reduce the need for overtime and allow your team to concentrate on bringing further innovation to your business.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The new program </b><a href="https://www.ukukrainetechbridge.org/"><b>TechBridge</b></a><b>, launched by the governments of Ukraine and the UK, marks the beginning of the next-generation digital infrastructure distributed across Europe and beyond. We spoke to Yevhen Kulinichenko, Chief Engineering Officer of Slagato technology's the technology partner of Fortune companies including EY, Nestle, and Jaguar. Yevhen talked about their latest trials aimed at enhancing software development processes by incorporating generative AI assistance.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT has gained a reputation as a transformative tool that reshapes certain aspects of our development processes. IT professionals are using it to automate and streamline specific tasks, such as assisting in writing test cases or providing quick solutions to common coding problems. On the business side, ChatGPT assists in rapid prototyping and ideation phases, where its ability to generate coherent, context-aware text can significantly speed up the initial stages of development. However, its effectiveness is constrained by the scope of its training and its lack of deep, project-specific context. It can suggest but not validate, nor can it understand the nuanced requirements of complex, custom software solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slagato technology’s </span><b>Center of Excellence (CoE)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an innovation hub where our technical teams conduct experiments and test new approaches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview covers our expert’s perspective on the use of AI, specifically focusing on GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models and their applications, limitations, and impacts on software development. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dive right in! What are your plans for contributing to the TechBridge project?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b>My plans for contributing to the TechBridge project are strategically focused on leveraging our technological expertise to maximize the project&#8217;s success while ensuring alignment with our broader business objectives. Firstly, we intend to deploy a cross-functional team of our best engineers and developers, who will work closely with the TechBridge project stakeholders. This team will not only bring in-depth technical knowledge but also a profound understanding of agile methodologies to ensure rapid and efficient project development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key aspect of our contribution will be the integration of advanced technologies like AI and cloud computing to enhance the project&#8217;s capabilities. For instance, we plan to utilize AI algorithms to analyze and optimize data flow, ensuring efficient processing and storage of data. Cloud computing resources will be leveraged for scalable infrastructure, ensuring the project can adapt to changing demands seamlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, we are committed to fostering an environment of innovation and collaboration. We&#8217;ll encourage our team to engage in creative problem-solving sessions and think-tank workshops with other TechBridge participants. This collaborative approach is designed to not only contribute our ideas but also to learn from the diverse perspectives and expertise within the TechBridge community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, we recognize the importance of sustainability in technology. Therefore, our involvement will also focus on developing sustainable and environmentally friendly technology solutions. We&#8217;ll explore and implement green computing practices to minimize the environmental impact of our technological contributions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, we plan to contribute a blend of technical excellence, innovative thinking, collaborative engagement, <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/fraud-detection-with-machine-learning-and-ai/">security-conscious practices</a>, and a commitment to sustainability to the TechBridge program. We aim to help set a foundation for its long-term success and growth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">You mentioned AI implementation as a focus area. Can you expand on that?</span></h2>
<p><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to build on the experience that we already have. In 2023, we conducted experiments on improving software development processes by implementing generative AI assistance. Results are still being finalized, but we&#8217;ve identified dozens of scenarios where ChatGPT can be safely utilized to streamline delivery and facilitate problem-solving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we delve deeper into the utilization of ChatGPT in software development, we&#8217;re uncovering its profound potential in augmenting our coding processes. For instance, when dealing with boilerplate code, ChatGPT can swiftly generate templates for commonly used code structures in various programming languages like Python or JavaScript, significantly reducing repetitive tasks. We&#8217;ve experimented with using it to draft initial versions of RESTful API endpoints, where it considers standard practices and even suggests appropriate HTTP methods and response codes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve also started leveraging ChatGPT for debugging assistance. By describing a bug in natural language, the model can suggest potential causes and solutions, drawing from a wide range of similar issues it has learned from. This doesn&#8217;t replace a developer&#8217;s expertise but acts as an additional tool to accelerate problem-solving. Thus, while ChatGPT is a game-changer in certain aspects of software development, it works best as a complement to human skills, enhancing productivity and quickly highlighting some basic blind spots or standard reusable patterns. However, it still cannot handle the complex logic, style, or requirements.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can ChatGPT handle tasks requiring senior-level expertise?</span></h2>
<p><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT is limited in <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/bloggg/web-application-architecture/">creating novel solutions</a>. It works by learning from vast amounts of text data to generate plausible word combinations. However, it neither invents nor actually comprehends ideas. It is still a mathematical algorithm that arranges words according to numeric probabilities. There is no independent consciousness that is inherent to human intelligence. ChatGPT’s utility is rather in quick recommendations based on existing knowledge.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does ChatGPT compare with development environment tools like PyCharm?</span></h2>
<p><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s an interesting question. Indeed, Integrated Development Environments (IDE) like PyCharm offer tools like code completion, debugging, and context-aware refactoring options that consider the entire project structure. What’s more, It can adapt to the style and requirements of the codebase it’s working with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, ChatGPT&#8217;s understanding of software languages and programming concepts is broad but can be superficial. It lacks the ability to understand the deeper context of a software project, such as project-specific architectures, dependencies, or the state of the current codebase. It can assist in generating code snippets, providing documentation references, or even suggesting solutions to coding problems. Still, it’s limited to the data that it’s trained on and doesn’t attend to the entire code structure and its state in real time like IDEs.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there any concerns about the misuse of ChatGPT?</span></h2>
<p><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, there&#8217;s a risk of misuse, especially if ChatGPT provides information based on public data that could be harmful. The potential for misuse of technologies like ChatGPT forms a crucial part of our risk assessment and management strategy. There&#8217;s always a possibility of inappropriate information being fed into AI models with malicious intent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in the software development realm, we can talk about the potential for intellectual property theft or inadvertent leakage. ChatGPT, when fed with sensitive data, could incorporate this information into its outputs, leading to data breaches. As a result, proprietary code or business logic could be exposed. So, for now, my recommendation is to refrain from trying to fix the code in ChatGPT or copy-pasting any information that might be considered sensitive. And since chatGPT 4 can now crawl the web, make sure your websites and social media accounts are properly protected as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, there&#8217;s the risk of psychological dependency on AI. Over-reliance of IT professionals on ChatGPT for code generation or problem-solving could lead to a degradation of fundamental skills. I think it&#8217;s vital to use such tools to augment, not replace, human expertise, ensuring that core development skills are retained and nurtured within the team.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, what&#8217;s your perspective on the future of ChatGPT and AI in collaborative programs like TechBridge?</span></h2>
<p><b>Yevhen Kulinichenko: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to the future, I anticipate significant advancements in tools like ChatGPT, particularly in their integration with more and more traditional software development tools and environments. We&#8217;re likely to see more sophisticated versions that offer better contextual understanding and can interact dynamically with existing codebases, potentially offering more nuanced and targeted suggestions, which will help us quickly scale and efficiently maintain <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/enterprise-software-development">global digital infrastructures</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These advancements could lead to models that not only assist in code generation but also play a role in code review processes, offering Slagato insights based on coding best practices and even specific project history. Furthermore, as AI models become more adept at understanding and generating human languages, they will become invaluable in bridging communication gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders, facilitating a clearer understanding of project goals and requirements. This evolution will require a shift in how we perceive these tools, not just as assistants but as integral components of our software development ecosystems, enhancing both efficiency and creativity.</span></p>
