We are very proud to say that, at the moment, Slagatois a zero-bench company because absolutely all our technical and non-technical specialists work on custom software development projects. What\u2019s more, we are even more proud to say that our clients continue choosing us as their trusted tech partner. But now, let us tell you what\u2019s new at Slagato technology.<\/p>\n<h2>Conferences and Events<\/h2>\n<p>In the first quarter of 2023, among other activities, our CEO, Alexander Radchenko participated in several conferences and events, among which were:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/nucc.no\/code-of-resilience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Code of Resilience<\/a> in Oslo, Norway.<\/p>\n<p>This event, hosted by the Norwegian-Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce, ICT-Norway, IT Ukraine Association, and VIS, was aimed at telling Norwegian businesses about the current state of the Ukrainian IT sector as well as its importance.

The Slagatoteam actively donates to the Ukrainian troops to help them defend the native land, save lives, and restore peace. For the last few months, we have organized a local charity auction where every Slagatoemployee could participate and place bids for branded products like hoodies and thermo-mugs, etc.<\/p>\n<p>We also have two funds functioning on a regular basis \u2013 a Fund for Colleagues from our Kyiv branch who had joined the Ukrainian troops to defend the country, and a Fund for Donation Suggestions. Every Slagatoteam member can propose a donation initiative like funding an animal shelter or helping to buy necessary things for a specific Ukrainian military unit, and the company will provide funds to cover this need.<\/p>\n<h2>Our Team Continues to Grow<\/h2>\n<p>While many companies are facing layoffs, we continue to hire new specialists. Moreover, we regularly seek and hire interns for different departments. Recently, we had a Project Management Intern job competition with an overwhelming number of candidates wishing to work at Slagato \u2013 300! All of them showed amazing potential and skills, and now, two specialists who meet our corporate values best have already become part of our team as interns.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in becoming a part of the Slagatoteam, check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/careers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Careers <\/a>section and apply.<\/p>\n<h2>Women\u2019s Community<\/h2>\n<p>The number of female specialists at Slagatois continuously growing and soon will reach 30%!

Right now we\u2019re building a Women in IT community that will grow in number and quality. Right now our Human Resources department works on planning and organizing various activities specifically for our female teammates.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Words<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, these are just the main news we shared today.
