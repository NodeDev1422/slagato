This signifies poor strategy development at the initial stages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slagato technology\u2019s expertise in conducting the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for system engineering and project management helps you avoid costly mistakes and achieve project success. Learn more about the benefits and deliverables in the article below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is the Discovery Phase?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before learning the intricacies of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you need to make sure you know which \u201cneighborhood\u201d you\u2019re in. When looking for answers online, you can come across a range of various definitions that have nothing to do with the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> concept that you really need to know.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s just clarify that, in this article, we are going to talk about the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as part of the <\/span><b>system architecture<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conducted by your software engineering partner, Slagato technology. We will also look at the alternative definitions from the <\/span><b>Project Management<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> perspective so that you know the difference.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first case, the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> encompasses the primary step of the Solution Architecture lifecycle (Lovatt, 2021) that creates a foundation for a successful solution. In this context, it typically includes three major types of activities:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Fact-checking. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoroughly studying all architectural inputs that are relevant to the problem area.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Engaging stakeholders.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Identifying people relevant to the solution scope and their responsibilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Establishing Success Criteria. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll never know if the solution turned out well if you don\u2019t set expectations, assessments, and success criteria beforehand.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Inputs to these activities:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> architectural artifacts, stakeholders register, business case. If some critical information is unavailable, the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has to be extended to cover investigation and modeling. Existing artifacts like business requirements are also subject to reformulation and modification if key stakeholders deem those insufficient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Deliverables:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technical approach outline, system design outline, project planning roadmap, wireframes, and prototypes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Important Differences<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our customers\u2019 internal business processes, the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase in project management <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">involves identifying the business value of some idea. Thus, the major deliverable is the business case. More often than not, we cover the system architecture concept of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because customers prefer to create their business cases internally (since it depends on many organization-specific and sensitive data).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary role of the business idea justification is defining a dominant business objective. This could be a market demand, organizational need, customers\u2019 request, technologically competitive edge, social responsibility, or legal requirements. Whatever the purpose, a project needs some rationale to begin with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Deliverables: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business case\/plan, current vs. future state, return on investment; list of prequalified vendors, predetermined clients, preexisting contracts, capital expenses (CapEx), and operational expenses (OpEx) plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this scenario, the main deliverable (business case) outlines the scope, audience, and purpose of the proposed work and establishes the value it could bring. A well-researched business case can show that a project is worth the investment. It is a strategic document.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, here Slagatosteps in on the next phase (which traditionally could be called the Initiation phase), where we define success criteria, preliminary scope and requirements, high-level risks and assumptions, summary milestones, summary budget, and key technical stakeholders, create a stakeholder register, develop a responsibility assignment matrix, establish communication channels, begin records management, review existing artifacts, determine a solution design, define access requirements for project work, obtain charter sign-off, and perform kickoff.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to Plan a Discovery Phase of a Project?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> planning at Slagatois adjusted to every individual request. Instead of proposing cookie-cutter solutions, we emphasize quality and usefulness, even if it\u2019s a preliminary system design outline. That\u2019s why, after the initial internal discussion, we allocate resources to cover the full-scope <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If we are working with the existing client, the planning phase can be very fast because we already know the artifacts and the current state. However, if we are working with a new customer, the planning process may take up to a few weeks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there is also a standard process at play; for example, our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> normally starts with activities like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preliminary meetings with a customer,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interviews with stakeholders,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contextual research,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Documentation study,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review of preexisting processes.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once we have a general understanding of the scope of work, we are ready to dive deeper and work on discovering appropriate technological solutions to the project in question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, when technical stakeholders say planning, they also mean all the activities of the actual, ongoing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase of a project<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So, just to clarify, all the processes of brainstorming and creating supporting documentation throughout the already initiated phase can be referred to as Planning.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Discovery Phase Deliverables?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are examples of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> deliverables that might be associated with software development projects. Note that it greatly depends on the customer and the particular objectives. For larger projects and sometimes for venture series startups, more paperwork is involved.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Existing Artifacts Review<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artifacts are tangible items, like documents or products, that were previously made and are available at the time the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starts. For example, we might ask to review the business case, current project documentation or previous designs, and so on. Without understanding what you already have, we won\u2019t be able to make informed conclusions and outline of what needs to be done next.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we are to build a complex system, we might ask to clarify your relationship with current or future clients, vendors, etc. Preexisting contracts might affect how the system needs to be shaped, e.g., what business processes and logic to include.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might supply such artifacts as a master service agreement (MSA), statement of work (SOW), or terms of reference (TOR).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Capital Expenses vs. Operational Expenses Assessment<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budget allocation is usually the customer&#8217;s call, but when we see room for optimization, we offer guidance. For instance, in heavy equipment facilities, projects often involve both operational expenditure (OpEx) for software, which doesn&#8217;t appreciate or depreciate, and capital expenditure (CapEx) for durable assets like equipment, which are taxed and appreciate\/depreciate over time. In such cases, we suggest ways to leverage technology to increase the value of those durable assets and lower OpEx, ultimately boosting ROI.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Example<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A client needs software for monitoring ice melting that might result in spring flood damage to a city at the foot of the mountain. The problem is that the visualization quality is poor, so the client is considering a multi-million dollar investment into cloud-based data processing architecture that improves quality with AI. We analyze their situation and point out that improving the physical layer (OSI Layer 1) by ensuring a clear line of sight between transceivers, along with minimum loss of local connectivity on Layers 2 and 3, could achieve similar, even better results faster and at a lower cost.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, we\u2019d advise enabling VLANs to isolate network traffic throughput and introducing QoS routing. Then, we could suggest lightweight software specifically designed for handling interference, phase delay, and signal loss issues to avoid operational lags. We would also ask questions about how satisfied the client is with the current data processing algorithms because GIS is known to work with huge amounts of data, so before doctoring that with AI, it is necessary to make sure that we do not work with erroneous and poorly pre-processed data in the first place (which can be achieved by well-known mathematical algorithms and quickly done using existing libraries). This software might focus on key data points and visualization techniques optimized for the available bandwidth, delivering clear visuals more reliably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Note:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The low-level software solution will depend on various factors like the facility&#8217;s specific needs, the type of wireless system, and the desired data representation. This example aims to illustrate the principle of offering software alternatives that capitalize on improved hardware conditions instead of relying solely on \u201cfashionable\u201d cloud solutions that don\u2019t necessarily address the core problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27491\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/software-alternatives.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of an example of software alternatives that utilize improved hardware conditions instead of cloud solutions.\" width=\"1550\" height=\"859\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/software-alternatives.jpg 1550w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/software-alternatives-300x166.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/software-alternatives-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/software-alternatives-768x426.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/software-alternatives-1536x851.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/software-alternatives-600x333.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/software-alternatives-450x249.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/software-alternatives-1000x554.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1550px) 100vw, 1550px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because capital assets will benefit the organization for years after the project ends, they may be sourced from the organization\u2019s budget, not the project\u2019s. That is often a point that needs to be escalated to a higher level of negotiation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Current State vs. Future State \/ Gap Analysis<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, the analyst will create a contrast-and-comparison table of the current state of project solutions vs. the desired improvement. While these statements should be clear and concise, they should not focus on either the technical or implementation aspects of the issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, instead of mentioning the future state as \u201cSales team is migrated to This CRM Brand,\u201d it is better to write \u201cSales leads are increased by 30%.\u201d Particular solutions to the future state will be designed at a later stage of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This document can focus on gaps, bottlenecks, and weaknesses in current processes, such as lack of automation or missed revenue caused by outdated software. Growth of business operations might also go here, as it is an opportunity for improvement.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Interface Inventory, IT Asset Inventory<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, any solution has multiple components at different levels of interaction and communication with each other. By creating an interface inventory, we are clarifying our understanding of the solution architecture and, therefore, can refer to it when deciding on the implementation roadmap priorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We document details like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the interface<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Destination<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rules and other events<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">items exchanged, including any supporting information<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workflows, itineraries<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre- or post-conditions.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Same goes for IT assets. We want to itemize all the physical and non-physical digital entities such as networks, servers, workstations, databases, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Project Charter<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually developed by the PM during the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase of project management<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this document is the cornerstone of the project and its main point of reference. It defines the reporting structure for decision-making, as well as the project\u2019s purpose, goals, objectives, requirements, high-level assumptions and constraints, high-level risks, success criteria, a summary milestone schedule, key stakeholders, a summary budget, and an initial key stakeholder register. The project success criteria, which serve as a benchmark for the quality of the produced outcome, are also included (Heldman, 2022).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Risk Assessment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase of a project<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also highlights possible issues and high-level solutions that are possible to suggest based on existing knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The basic version of the document is usually an executive summary that provides a top-level synopsis of the problem, the proposed solution, the justification, and the expected benefit, but it skips the analysis behind these decisions. That analysis, along with the estimates of financials, would be included in the more in-depth version of the risk assessment. Depending on the size of the project, it could include the following elements:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Problem statement:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Description of the issue.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Analysis:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A root cause analysis or any other analysis that predicts the outcome of the stated issue.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Recommended solution:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The solution that was analyzed as most likely to succeed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Proposed solutions: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternative approaches to the recommended solution, their strengths and limitations.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial risk assessment documents are typically reviewed, refined, and formalized in the project charter.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Preliminary Scope Statement<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outlines the tasks to be done and specifies what&#8217;s not part of the project. It&#8217;s often called the big-picture scope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A PM looks at the charter&#8217;s requirements and makes a detailed scope statement during planning. This statement gets added to the scope baseline and lists the individual tasks needed for the project. However, the charter&#8217;s scope is preliminary until more analysis is done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, it describes the project, what needs to be delivered, how it will be accepted, important points in the timeline, and what&#8217;s not included in the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Solution Design Outline<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution architecture is often the most anticipated part of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Everyone wants to know the architect\u2019s vision of how to build the solution to estimate what it would take to make it a reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determining which solutions are needed and how they will interact with existing infrastructure is what our architects want to show. We also want to plan for the future, making this solution maintainable and scalable to support the business&#8217;s growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution design process has two main outputs: a high-level conceptual design and a low-level technical roadmap.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Technical Roadmap<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our tech team, including the architect, developers, UX designers, and more, are the main stakeholders for this document. They want to outline the low-level tech details, such that are specific enough to put into sprints and iterations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Importance of the Discovery Phase<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> activities target a primary goal: developing a <\/span><b>conceptual design<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for part or all of the project. The proposed solutions must align with our customer\u2019s business requirements, therefore addressing business needs and opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might be one of the most challenging parts of the solution design pipeline because we need to showcase the value of our proposed design without going into too much detail. It is important to keep an open mind and stay away from specifics because doing so might result in focusing on logical conclusions rather than premises. On the flip, more investigation and flexibility down the pipeline typically result in better working systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importantly, the conceptual solution outline ideally holds the core logical reasoning, which can be extended into and connected to all further levels, down to the physical. Due to the nature of modern system architectures, the level of technological volatility might be high, so making a high-level solution outline ensures that we will not make premature decisions that will have to be redone further down the line. It is essential to acknowledge that the solution architecture life cycle exhibits a high degree of parallelism and iterative refinement based on accumulating knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Discovery Phase Best Practices<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adhering to industry-wide standards such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iso.org\/standard\/84893.html\"><b>ISO\/IEC\/IEEE<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is considered the best practice in the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some of the activities described in these guidelines include the following.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Gathering Architecture Inputs<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A number of factors determine whether useful architecture artifacts are available at the start of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Architecture maturity:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> whether architecture practice is established and working well in the organization or enterprise and if there is an efficient repository of artifacts that can be easily accessed and in which it is easy to find relevant artifacts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Overlap with current problem area:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if the new problem to be solved is in an area or operational domain that has never been addressed before, there will be fewer relevant artifacts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Clarity of understanding of the current problem:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if the focus of the problem is too broad or ill-defined, it is harder to distinguish relevant artifacts, and too many irrelevant ones may be included as inputs.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main product of this activity is a catalog of relevant architecture artifacts for the operational domain of the solution vision. At this stage, it is not necessary to examine the artifacts in detail, but it is important to identify them and know they are available when needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the artifacts are organized in a repository, then more details will be available, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Date of production and modification<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Version number<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owner<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business area<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Related artifacts that would be impacted by change, and any dependencies.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also useful to record the reason for selecting this artifact by linking it to an element or concept in the problem domain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Defining Stakeholder Engagement<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to ISO\/IEC 42010:2011 and TOGAF definitions, stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations having an interest or concern in a solution.

The logic here is simple: if all the requirements are met \u2013 the project deliverable is considered successful. Alternatively, the success can also be judged from the perspective of project constraints like time and resources \u2013 in this case, their optimization would imply high-quality results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further down the line, business requirements also become a basis for us to create a solution design proposal and a roadmap outline. Keep in mind that if we are adopting an Agile methodology, business requirements might come and go as the project evolves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The documenting process is sometimes more complex than writing something like \u201cOk so my idea for a project is this\u2026\u201d If we are taking the business value seriously, our business analysts need to go through several stages:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Capturing: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">listing requirements, plus simple yet actionable explanations.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Validating:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> checking for completeness and correctness.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Verifying:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> testing requirements to see if they are the best option, checking for conflicts and overlaps.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resulting requirements catalog might include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the business requirement;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ID;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">description;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justification;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Category;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Status;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Change control details.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The requirements catalog is useful for tracing how business requirements become system or data requirements. It can also be used to check if the business needs to consider additional operational measures such as new SLAs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To document business requirements, we might interview stakeholders, review existing artifacts, or even make new ones (such as use cases, user stories, data models, etc.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Creating Solution Proposal<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this stage of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are approaching the most interesting part \u2013 describing and illustrating our vision for the solution. We need to focus on core models without swinging away into specifics that could potentially lead us astray. So here we are showing the essence of the design, not constrained by jumping to conclusions or step-by-step plans yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there are several good alternatives, we might propose more than one solution for a customer to choose from. It is also important to come to an agreement between all the stakeholders at this stage.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Visuals<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complex tech solutions really come alive in stakeholders\u2019 imaginations once they are presented visually. For that, we can use a variety of mediums:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diagrams, charts, graphs, maps<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wireframes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Design mockups<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And more!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our objectives here are to abstract high enough from technical buzzwords, convey meaning, and, ultimately, obtain stakeholders\u2019 approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Supporting Artifacts<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nice visuals are fun, but stakeholders want to understand how the solution addresses their area of business. For that, we dive deeper into supporting artifacts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a sample high-level architecture definition:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outlines the infrastructure layer that an application will be built on top of<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depicts main components together and highlights proposed building blocks<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifies relations and interactions between subsystems<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defines security boundaries and considerations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Declares data types and their storage approaches<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determines application resiliency and failover processes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlights the insights of the middleware layer<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Illustrates the principles of scaling and load balancing of the system and its components.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indicates observability functionalities and toolset<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marks out external interfaces and integration capabilities and approaches<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Project discovery phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might result not only in the collection of information but in the true discovery of requirements that stakeholders didn\u2019t know before. That is why, to clarify our solution ingenuity, it\u2019s useful to maintain artifacts like traceability\/cross-reference grids where we show the links between the initial idea and its evolution path, providing explanations for the variations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Outlining the Step-byStep Plan<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this stage, we collect all the artifacts we obtained or produced before and go down the rabbit hole of the specifics. We are scoping the solution, analyzing interfaces and risks for smaller deliverables (like features), looking at the tech stack options, and offering a high-level step-by-step plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Scope Definition<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After choosing a solution, we formalize its scope by detailing changes in each business area, specifying their nature (new, existing modification\/removal\/replacement), and linking them to relevant architecture documentation. This ensures clarity and avoids conflicting efforts throughout the solution&#8217;s lifecycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Building Block Analysis<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building block analysis helps identify reusable components within the organization and assess their suitability for the solution. It creates a solution-building block model detailing each component&#8217;s name, category, ownership, current state, and required modifications.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>KPI Documentation<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before initiating the project, we need to formalize our acceptance criteria with stakeholders. What is considered successful? What is considered done? What are the key metrics that we are striving for? What is the logic behind deciding what\u2019s good and what isn\u2019t? All that needs to be described at the stage of documenting KPIs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most often, the KPI documentation types will depend on methodologies and stakeholders involved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples of KPI documentation:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Budget<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (cost performance, cost variance, planned value, etc.)\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Performance <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(schedule performance\/value, resource capacity\/velocity, stories in development, tasks reopened, changes accepted, burndown, cumulative flow, code coverage, etc.)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Wrapping Up<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Phase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the most exciting stages in software development.
