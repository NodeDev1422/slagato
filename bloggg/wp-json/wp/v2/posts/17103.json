It\u2019s crucial to know how to estimate the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost of a mobile app design<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Factors Determine the Cost to Design an App?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re running a seasoned app company or a startup, developers have to make efforts to ensure the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A reasonable timeframe for development and launching<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zero bugs, errors, and any other issues<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users are willing to pay for your app, in-app purchases, and\/or a subscription<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each application software has a unique purpose, set of features, and target audiences. That\u2019s why the total <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also varies. While there are quite a few factors that affect your expenses, there are also things that you can do to manage both these determinants and your expectations better.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Complexity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logically, a more complicated app will lead to a higher <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a basic app that has limited features and functionality, developers need less time. Complex applications often contain more features, advanced algorithms, and powerful integrations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Actionable insight:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Consider whether your app needs features like live chat, payment gateways, third-party app integrations, or customized add-ons, as these tend to ramp up overall expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Platforms<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your chosen platforms \u2013 iOS, Android, or both \u2013 will considerably shape your app design cost. Designing for only one platform is considerably cheaper; however, targeting users of both platforms ensures you have a bigger customer base and larger profits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, the main reason for a higher mobile app design price is the programming languages for these two operating systems. This means designing for both platforms simultaneously may require separate teams or developers with cross-platform skills, which can inflate costs further.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The choice between native or web apps also impacts the budget. Since native apps \u2013 where mobile apps fall under \u2013 are defined as those built for certain device types, they\u2019re more expensive to develop.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Actionable insight: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take time to analyze your target audience. For example, if your intended users would benefit from an on-the-go app, opt for mobile-only software. You can justify cross-platform development later should you think your audience tends to use your software across all devices.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Design Elements and User Experience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost of app design also depends on how recognizable your brand is within the app. Your app should be consistent with your brand&#8217;s look and feel. This includes logos, colors, and fonts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One key factor here is the user experience (UX), which is the overall flow and ease of navigation. Part of UX can also be impactful visual aesthetics, too. These include the user interface (UI), animations, and in-app interactions, which developers may meticulously design.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Actionable insight:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Your app should be well-structured, meaning users can simply navigate. Doing so provides users with a positive experience. While giving them such ease, you should also focus on staying true to your brand. Balancing this may incur costs, but satisfaction and user retention can make it worthwhile.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Team Type<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you hire freelancers, an in-house team, or outsource to an app development agency will affect the overall cost. Here\u2019s a quick list of these team types\u2019 cost levels, pros, and cons for you to weigh your choices:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Freelancers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><b>Cost:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Low<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><b>Pros:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This tier has the most flexible rates for startups with less complex app needs. Note that there are freelancers who have diverse skill sets that can help with sudden changes in development.\u00a0 <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><b>Cons:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Due to the lack of supervision, quality can be unpredictable. Moreover, potential timezone problems may cause challenging communication and updates.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><b>In-house Team<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><b>Cost:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Mid to High<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><b>Pros:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Since this will be your team, there\u2019s the potential for excellent collaboration and more control over the project.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><b>Cons:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The cost of hiring and maintaining an in-house team can be steep due to overhead expenses such as office space, equipment, and training.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><b>Outsourced Agency<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><b>Cost:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Mid to High<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><b>Pros:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Here, you\u2019ll access a company\u2019s broad professional skills and resources. They can even offer an all-in-one solution, from idea conception to post-launch updates.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><b>Cons:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Can be more expensive than hiring your team. Timezone complications might also occur when working with overseas agencies.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Actionable insight:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You should define your desired work quality of work and the level of control you wish to maintain over the project. Regardless of who you hire, don&#8217;t forget to check portfolios and reviews to see whether you\u2019re speaking with the right professionals. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Team Location<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned, geography can also affect the overall <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to time zones. More often than not, developers in North America and Western Europe charge higher compared to those in Asia.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These discrepancies are often due to differing costs of living and market standards.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Actionable insight: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose a partner developer that\u2019s able to align with your time zone. Remember, while an agency or freelancer may be overseas, they can bring fresh perspectives to your projects. Ensure you clarify some information about your target audiences, including their potential expectations, needs, and values.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average mobile app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> depends on these factors \u2013 but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. It\u2019s still the steps of the process that set the base prices.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">App Design Cost Breakdown<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While various components make up the actual <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, understanding them can be easier as you see the price of each element. Take these \u2013 all while considering the factors mentioned above \u2013 to get at least a rough estimate of how much your total spend will be.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Pre-Design Costs: Market Research and Concept Development<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market research lets you have a view of your demographics and some information about them. These bits of info, in turn, solidify your knowledge of your target audience\u2019s wants, needs, and behavior, which you can later use as the foundation of your app\u2019s concepts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As shown in the table below, there are around 800,000 market research analysts in the U.S., with the population growing at a fast rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/market-research-analysts.jpg\" alt=\"Table with info about market research analysts in the U.S.\" width=\"1550\" height=\"1074\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/market-research-analysts.jpg 1550w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/market-research-analysts-300x208.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/market-research-analysts-1024x710.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/market-research-analysts-768x532.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/market-research-analysts-1536x1064.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/market-research-analysts-600x416.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/market-research-analysts-450x312.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/market-research-analysts-1000x693.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1550px) 100vw, 1550px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/business-and-financial\/market-research-analysts.htm\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, most industries make use of market research, highlighting the potential increase in demand and median pay in the following years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This usually takes 6\u20137 weeks, depending on how large the sample population is. If you expect one researcher to work on your project for at least 40 hours per week, the average could start at around $1,500\/researcher for one entire research process. However, keep in mind that not every software development contractor conducts this type of research, so you might want to consider services of a specialized market research vendor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you know about your audience, you can now conceptualize your app. This includes drafting its primary features and user journey. This is when you want to start working with software development specialists. In most methodologies, this stage is called the Discovery Phase. It includes close interaction with business stakeholders for understanding the business logic and offering the best solution in terms of the app experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Overall pre-design costs: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market research starts at $1,500 per researcher, Discovery Phase &#8211; $10,000-$15,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Core Design Phases: Wireframing, Prototyping, UI\/UX Design<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where the concepts are brought to life. When researching the idea of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you\u2019ll see the use of terms like wireframing, prototypes, and mockups. The core design phase starts with wireframing, similar to blueprints of architectural structures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In wireframing, you lay out the structure of the app and determine the functionalities for each part. This usually comes as the easiest core design phase, which doesn\u2019t require heavy designing. All it usually takes to create a wireframe is the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content blocks, such as placements for logos, artworks, or text descriptions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigation menus<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buttons<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After finalizing these on a piece of paper or sketching app, developers then put them into prototypes, which turn the blueprints of navigation into actual app interactions. You can usually do the wireframes on your own, but they often come in a package with prototyping and mockups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While prototypes have the actual interactions, mockups are where the UI\/UX design shines. Here, designers discuss with you the colors, fonts, and images of the app, showing its complete visuals. To make sure that your users get the best experience, you might need to start from working with a business analyst who helps you create requirements for UI\/UX.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wireframes can cost you anywhere from $2000 \u2013 this also depends on whether the freelancer or agency you hire charges per hour. For example, you might need to hire both the designer and the business analyst for 20 hours per week each. Prototypes start at $4,000, while mockup designs range from $3,000 to $15,000.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Overall core design costs:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Starts at ~$7,000<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Post-Design Costs: Testing, Revisions, and Final Touches<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of whether you outsource only UI\/UX design or the app development and deployment altogether, you need to perform the quality assurance phase. Developers typically test apps for bugs, compatibility issues, and performance loopholes. These issues cause apps to lag, one of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/top-12-reasons-why-users-frequently-uninstall-mobile-apps-fakhruddin\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">top reasons people uninstall their apps<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So, while visuals and the intended experience might be appealing, the most important consideration is for all your ideas to perform seamlessly before the app gets out there on the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to ensure that your app undergoes all kinds of tests, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performance and function<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Installation<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Device compatibility<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usability<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why testing costs can start at $5,000. The only test not within the scope of developers is usability, which real test users should take. However, agencies sometimes handle this part as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To reduce the costs of testing an app, you can ask the agency to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/qa-and-software-testing-services\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">start testing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the development\u2019s early stages. Sometimes professionals call it \u201cshifting left\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making necessary revisions and fine-tuning to ensure optimal user experience can require an additional $1,000 to $2,000. Wrapping up with final touches to perfect your app might entail a further $500 to $1,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Overall post-design costs:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $5,000+ depending on complexity<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Maintenance and Updates<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though not traditionally part of the design process, maintaining the app and rolling out timely updates keeps the app functional and relevant. This can incur a recurring cost of about 20% of the total <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">app design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> annually.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Custom Features &amp; Design<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional features such as push notifications, geo-location tracking, or third-party integrations will increase the price of the app. Of course, you need those to fit well into the overall UI\/UX, and if you need custom design, this will increase the cost as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pricing for these vary widely depending on the nature of the feature and the complexity involved in its integration. It could range anywhere from $1,000 to $30,000 and higher, depending on the complexity, whether or not you need business analysis, the number of features, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To give you a quick look, here\u2019s a quick app design cost calculation if we were to base it on a really basic app:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,500 (Pre-design) + $7,000 (Core design) + $6,500 (Post-design) = $15,000<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$15,000 (Design) + $7,500 (Post-design) + 8*$3,000 (eight custom features) = $46,500<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, these figures are mere estimations and can fluctuate based on various factors such as project scope, timelines, and the expertise of your design and\/or development team.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">How Does the Design Process Affect an App Design Price?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As previously mentioned, this is the longest part of the core design process, which means it also affects the overall <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost to design an app<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two primary cost-driving factors here: UX and UI, the cornerstones of an exceptional app design.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UX design focuses on the interactive component of the design process. This is the main reason you do your market research, hence its effect on the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile app design price<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With knowledge about the users and their needs in mind, developers then draft wireframes and make prototypes. The mockup is then tested by real users who provide feedback about your app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, UI design gets into the detailed visual and interactive aspects of the app. This phase is where the prototypes and mockups come to life \u2013 all with the help of a style guide established by you and your partner developer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s the overall design, including the setup of buttons and icons, that makes UI quite a more expensive part of the process. Whether you hire animators for better transitions, buy stock photos, or have your creative team provide you with content, it\u2019s going to cost you money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/services\/ui-ux-design-services\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UX and UI design<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> play off each other, forming a cohesive aesthetic and functional identity for your app. That\u2019s why it\u2019s only vital that you understand how these two affect your total <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile application design cost<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Tips on How to Save on App Design Costs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no need to be intimidated by the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost to design an app<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With a few simple tips, you can save a significant amount of money and avoid unnecessary costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prioritize the key features; you can build on them later.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A well-researched project can save redesigning costs and ensure clarity as you relay information to your partner developer.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UX matters, so Invest in good interactive design from the beginning.

This can reduce the graphic design time and cost.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep the design and functionality intuitive and straightforward.
